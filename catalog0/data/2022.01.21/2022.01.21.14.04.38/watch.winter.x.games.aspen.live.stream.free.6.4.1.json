  "description": "# Winter x games Aspen Live Stream\n\nLive Link : https://cutt.ly/1IGIGdq\n\nX Games Aspen begins Friday with five competition windows exclusively available via streaming on the XGames social media and the ESPN App, before moving to ESPN for primetime coverage of the highly anticipated Monster Energy Men’s Snowboard SuperPipe and fan-favorite Snowboard Knuckle Huck competitions.\n\n# Live Link : https://cutt.ly/1IGIGdq\n\nSaturday and Sunday host a full slate of X Games action with an ABC and ESPN window each day. Saturday begins on ABC as queen of X Games, Jamie Anderson, looks to defend her double golds in Jeep Women’s Snowboard Slopestyle and Pacifico Women’s Snowboard Big Air. Then evening coverage on ESPN focused on Men’s Snowboard and Ski Big Air contests. Sunday is all about Ski as the ABC window covers Jeep Men’s Ski Slopestyle during the day and ESPN’s evening coverage highlights Men’s Ski SuperPipe and Knuckle Huck.\n\nThe next few weeks are going to be quite busy for some of the top male and female snowboarders and skiers in the world. That's because a number of them aren't heading to Beijing for the 2022 Winter Olympics quite yet. The 2022 Winter X Games are set to take place in Aspen, Colorado, from Friday to Sunday, with a host of medals up for grabs. Among the athletes participating will be several who will then take part in the Olympics in February.\n\nAs it has been since 2002, the Winter X Games are being held at Buttermilk Mountain. However, this year's event will have a special feel after the 2021 edition was held without fans because of the coronavirus pandemic. This year, people who are fully vaccinated will be able to attend the competitions.",
