  "description": "This small library uses cecil to inspect MSIL code found in .NET assemblies instead of `Assembly.Load` which ensures that you do not have to load it's dependencies beforehand. This is particularly useful if you just want to know what .NET target framework an assembly is targeting without running the risk of catching an exception from `Assembly.Load` because of a missing dependency.\n\nA powershell version is also available at: https://gist.github.com/peters/6991125",
