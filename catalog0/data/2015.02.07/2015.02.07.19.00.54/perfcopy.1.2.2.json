  "description": "Extension methods providing high performance deep copy capability for of arrays of common value types - currently: byte, char, short, int, long, and their unsigned brethren where applicable.\nConsiderably faster than Array.Copy - and it's also faster than Buffer.BlockCopy in most situations!\n\nHigh-performance enabled through use of optimised 'unsafe' blocks.\n\nThis package could be a good addition to other packages if you're building in copying of some kind that would benefit from being fast.",
