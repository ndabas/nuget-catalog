  "description": "Academy.Collections [Beta].\n\nAs the name suggests, this library contains new collections that works efficiently and its implementation is oriented to what you really need, and do not pretend to bring you a large list of complex collections which understanding will remove your developing experience from an easy and comfortable one.\nAs a Microsoft .NET Framework developer your intentions are very far from learn new concepts every time you work with libraries external to the BCL. Thatâ€™s why, Academy.Collections has been implemented using the same principles as Microsoft libraries. Objects and members definitions uses very similar names and features that you are usual to deal with, then your code experience will be as intuitive as always has been.\nThe number of collections contained in this library is a result of a deep research of what developers had coded in order to solve problems beyond the bounds of the Microsoft .NET Framework BCL. This implementations pretends also to solve the bigger number of problems with the lesser definitions. \nThe intentions that sustains Academy.Collections are very far from implementing a very large amount of collections, operations and algorithm that oppress the developers when finding what they want to solve their problems. We want, beyond a good performance, a comfortable and easy platform for the Microsoft .NET Framework developers.",
