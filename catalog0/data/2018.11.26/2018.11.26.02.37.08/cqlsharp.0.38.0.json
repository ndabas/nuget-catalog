  "description": "CqlSharp is a high performance, asynchronous Cassandra CQL binary protocol client implementing the ADO.NET data provider interfaces.\n\n      It's main features are:\n      * The API implements the ADO.NET interfaces. If you are familiar with SqlConnection, SqlCommand, and SqlReader, you should be able to use CqlSharp with no difficulty.\n      * CqlSharp is an implementation of the (new) CQL Binary Protocol and therefore requires Cassandra 1.2 and up\n      * CqlSharp supports all the binary protocol v2 features: batching, paging, bound query variables, result schema caching, check-and-set (CAS) statements, and sasl-authentication\n      * Supports fast mapping of objects to query parameters, or query results to objects. Mapping is tunable by decorating your classes via Table and Column attributes.\n      * Query tracing, timeouts and cancellation is supported\n      * The API is predominately [asynchronous](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/hh191443.aspx), heavily relying on the System.Threading.Tasks namespace. Synchronous alternatives are available for convenience.\n      * Configuration is done through connection strings. The simultaneous use of multiple Cassandra clusters is supported.\n      * Extensive logging, including support for custom logger implementations\n      \n      See https://github.com/reuzel/CqlSharp/wiki/Features for an extensive feature list.",

  "releaseNotes": "## Version 0.38.0 - Fixes and Improved Aliveness Checking of Cassandra Nodes\n      * Fixed bug that hampered exponential backoff\n      * Succesfull connection to a node must be made before it is marked as up again, keeping it out-of-scope of connection strategies until proven up.\n      * Fixing issue where multiple node UP notifications are received in a short time\n      * Clearing prepared query ids, forcing queries to be reprepared when node is marked down\n      * Making sure that at least a single query attempt is done when MaxRetryCount setting is set to 0\n      * MEF fix: now using correct directories for loading extensions\n\n      ## Version 0.37.0 - TraceLogger and Fixes on cluster reconfiguration\n      * Fix crash when nodes are added to a running system (and have no tokens gossiped). CqlSharp now reloads configurations every minute until all tokens are found.\n      * Fix missing logger binding when using exclusive connection strategy\n      * Simplified logger classes and added TraceLogger (thanks to justmara)\n\n      ...\n\n      See https://github.com/reuzel/CqlSharp/blob/master/ChangeLog.md for the full changelog.",
