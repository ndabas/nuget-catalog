Once your game has a following then WordJong will use a metric to see how many premium players often play this game and then you will be rewarded with a stipend.\nOr you can have your digital reward earnings transferred directly into your PayPal account. Once this is done you can proceed to purchase Generator directly from the game store at no extra cost.\nGenerally speaking WordJong is a safe environment for your kids to spend time in but be warned there are people out there who try to take advantage of the fact that most people playing WordJong are kids. To ensure that your kids can’t get scammed I recommend keeping their WordJong password a secret from them so that they can never accidentally give it away.\nThink of WordJong instead like an app store. The “storefront” recommends games for you to play and you can also search through the games available or browse through different categories and genres. A lot of players also share games among themselves or find things recommended online by creators and YouTubers.\nIf you are using WordJong generator then There are a number of contests run on the web every month where the winner will either go home with some genuine Generator or cash. Enter and answer all the questions correctly fill in the survey install the giveaway app and wait for them to arrive.\n",
