  "description": "Normally when you look at Exception.StackTrace, it looks pretty bad for async method calls, and doesn't even include line numbers when it's run on a device like Phone which lacks PDBs.\n\n\nThis package provides an alternative, Exception.StackTraceEx(), which has cleaned up async output, and which gives line and file numbers even on phone.\n\n\nThis way, if your app crashes, you can synthesize much better crash reports for the user to email back to you.\n\n\nAwait DownloadAsync(url).Log()\n\n\nTo get that richer information in exception stack-traces, you have to augment your \"await expr\" calls with \"await expr.Log()\", as shown above.\n\n\nAwait DownloadAsync(url).Log(\"DownloadAsync\",url)\n\n\nIf you chose to include more information, then the exception stack traces you get will be even richer and more actionable.",
