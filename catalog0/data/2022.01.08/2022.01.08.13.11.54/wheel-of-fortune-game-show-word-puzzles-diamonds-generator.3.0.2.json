  "description": "Wheel of Fortune is one of the longest-running TV shows on the air, so perhaps it’s no surprise it’s gone through many different iterations over the years. Originally titled Shopper’s Bazaar, the first Wheel of Fortune pilot came out in 1973 and was targeted mainly towards women. \nClick here==> https://gamesapp.pro/wof\nAs the name suggests, Shopper’s Bazaar put more focus on shopping than later versions of the game. Contestants solved word puzzles, their success on which, alongside the spin of a vertical wheel, determined what prizes they won. Chuck Woolery became host of Shopper’s Bazaar. He stayed in the role for a year before the game was restructured into Wheel of Fortune in 1974, and he left.\n\nThe new iteration of Wheel of Fortune brought it closer to its modern self, but in many ways it was still a developing TV show. The classic horizontal Fortune wheel, which contestants spun, was introduced to the game in 1974, and the puzzle game board was increased to its current size. \n\nThis board was originally intended to be mechanically operated, with automatic tile-flipping, but the flipping mechanism wasn’t completed in time for taping. Susan Stafford, the first Wheel of Fortune tile-flipper was hired to turn the letters on the board. She was so popular that later, even after the board was automated, a letter-turner would remain on the show. Initially, Edd Byrnes was hired to host the revamped show, but he tested poorly with audiences. Chuck Woolery came back to replace Byrnes before the new show went to air.",
