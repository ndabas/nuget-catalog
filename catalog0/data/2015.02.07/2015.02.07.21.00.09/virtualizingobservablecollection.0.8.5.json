  "description": "See:\n\nhttp://alphachitech.wordpress.com/2015/01/31/virtualizing-observable-collection/\n\nSo, what to do about it? We made one ourselves – the VirtualizingObservableCollection, which does the following:\n◾Implements the same interfaces as ObsevableCollection<T> so you can use it anywhere you’d use an ObsevableCollection<T> – no need to change any of your existing controls.\n◾Supports true multi-user read/write without resets (maximizing performance for large-scale concurrency scenarios).\n◾Manages memory on its own so it never runs out of memory, no matter how large the data set is (especially important for mobile devices).\n◾Natively works asynchronously – great for slow network connections and occasionally-connected models.\n◾Works great out of the box, but is flexible and extendable enough to customize for your needs.\n◾Has a data access performance curve so good it’s just as fast as the regular ObsevableCollection – the cost of using it is negligible.\n◾Works in any .NET project because it’s implemented in a Portable Code Library (PCL).",
