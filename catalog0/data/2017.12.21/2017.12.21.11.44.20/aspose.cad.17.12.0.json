  "description": "Aspose.CAD is a library for working with CAD file formats. The library allows to export CAD drawings into Pdfs or any other raster image format. The library has a large scalable and easy to use API, it is a cross platform solution and performs CAD processing using the same set of algorithms for different platforms. Unlike other solutions does not require AutoCAD to be installed and is a fully managed solution.",
