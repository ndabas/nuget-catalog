  "description": "SketchUp is a 3D modeling computer program for a wide range of drawing applications.\n\nWhoever asked for complicated CAD software? SketchUp is hands-down the most intuitive and easy-to-learn 3D drawing tool around.  SketchUp isn’t just for 3D models though. Draw plans, elevations, details, title blocks and a lot more with LayOut. SketchUp is accurate to a thousandth of an inch, so you can design, specify, and plan with as much or little detail as you need. \n\n* Create 3D models of buildings, furniture, interiors, landscapes, and more.\n* Customize the SketchUp interface to reflect the way you work.\n* Share 3D models as walkthrough animations, scenes, or printouts, with realistic light and shadows. You can even print a model on a 3D printer.\n* Import files from other 3D modeling programs or tools, or export your SketchUp file for use with other popular modeling and image-editing software.\n\n## [Hardware requirement](https://help.sketchup.com/en/sketchup/sketchup-hardware-and-software-requirements)\nSketchUp v2017 no longer has software rendering of models.  It requires a 3D class video card with 1GB of memory or higher and hardware acceleration. Please ensure that the video card driver supports OpenGL version 3.0 or higher and is [up to date](https://help.sketchup.com/article/36254).\n\n\"*SketchUp's performance relies heavily on the graphics card driver and its ability to support OpenGL 3.0 or higher. To test your graphics card's compatibility, please download and run the [SketchUp 2017 Checkup application](http://help.sketchup.com/en/sucheck). Historically, people have seen problems with Intel-based cards with SketchUp. We don't recommend using these graphics cards with SketchUp at this time.*\"\n\nThis package makes no attempt to confirm that this hardware requirement is met.\n\n###  Freeware Licensing Note\nSketchUp Make software is [licensed only for non-commercial use for your internal business purposes](https://www.sketchup.com/license/c/sketchup). Non-commercial use means that **you may not sell, rent, lease or lend the output of the Software**. Any other use requires the purchase of a SketchUp Pro license.\n\n### Package End-of-Life\nUnlike previous releases of this package, this is **not** a SketchUp Pro 2017 trial that can be licensed or reduced back to SketchUp Make.  This release of SketchUp Make is the last, installable, free version of SketchUp.  Subsequent versions of SketchUp are either Pro (commercial) or web-based and will not be built as Chocolatey Packages.  If you want SketchUp Pro 2017, [the previous version of this package](https://chocolatey.org/packages/sketchup/2017.2.2555) should still work with:  `choco install sketchup --version 2017.2.2555`\n\n#### Package Parameters\nBy default, this package will uninstall a 2016 version of SketchUp (if found).  If you want to have both versions installed at the same time (keeping the 2016 version), use a `/Keep` parameter.  **Note:** The 2016 version will **not** be removable via Chocolatey  after using this option.\n\nExample:   `choco install sketchup -params '\"/Keep\"'`.",
