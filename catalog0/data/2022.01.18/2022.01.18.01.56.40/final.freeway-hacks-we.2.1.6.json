The official Final Freeway site strongly advises against using schemes like account generators. They say that anyone asking you to input your details anywhere is scamming you and that you won’t receive a glitched account or Final Freeway. The terms of service also warn against it too. They say that you cannot obtain “exploited game or experience content.” This includes hacked accounts with Generator. If you’re caught doing this they reserve the right to immediately close your account.\nAlternatively you can redeem your Final Freeway gift card when checking out from the Final Freeway shop.\nIt is! And you don’t win at Final Freeway really. Sure there are individual games you could win but the real draw of Final Freeway is just to be a place to hang out play lots of stuff and maybe do so with your friends.\nWhen you design your own game you have the choice to create private game servers. This means that players can stop others from joining their server so it can be just their personal friends and no randoms.\n",
