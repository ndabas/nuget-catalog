  "description": "Chocolatey is a package manager for Windows (like apt-get but for Windows). It was designed to be a decentralized framework for quickly installing applications and tools that you need. It is built on the NuGet infrastructure currently using PowerShell as its focus for delivering packages from the distros to your door, err computer.\n\nChocolatey is brought to you by the work and inspiration of the community, the work and thankless nights of the [Chocolatey Team](https://github.com/orgs/chocolatey/people), with Rob heading up the direction.\n\nYou can host your own sources and add them to Chocolatey, you can extend Chocolatey's capabilities, and folks, it's only going to get better.\n\n### Commands\nThere are quite a few commands you can call - you should check out the [command reference](https://chocolatey.org/docs/commands-reference). Here are the most common:\n\n * Help - choco -? or choco command -?\n * Search - choco search something\n * List - choco list -lo\n * Config - choco config list\n * Install - choco install baretail\n * Pin - choco pin windirstat\n * Outdated - choco outdated\n * Upgrade - choco upgrade baretail\n * Uninstall - choco uninstall baretail\n\n#### Alternative installation sources:\n * Install ruby gem - choco install compass -source ruby\n * Install python egg - choco install sphynx -source python\n * Install windows feature - choco install IIS -source windowsfeatures\n * Install webpi feature - choco install IIS7.5Express -source webpi\n\n#### More\nFor more advanced commands and switches, use `choco -?` or `choco command -h`. You can also look at the [command reference](https://chocolatey.org/docs/commands-reference), including how you can force a package to install the x86 version of a package.\n\n### Create Packages?\nWe have some great guidance on how to do that. Where? I'll give you a hint, it rhymes with socks! [Docs!](https://chocolatey.org/docs/create-packages)\n\nIn that mess there is a link to the [PowerShell Chocolatey module reference](https://chocolatey.org/docs/helpers-reference).",

  "releaseNotes": "See all - https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/blob/stable/CHANGELOG.md\n\n## 0.10.3\n\n### BREAKING CHANGES\n\n * Fix - Do Not Check `$LastExitCode` - Only error a package install if script errors or set a different exit code when it is specifically set - see [#1000](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/1000)\n\nStarting in v0.9.10, Chocolatey started checking `$LASTEXITCODE` in addition to the script command success as a way to be more helpful in determining package failures. This meant it offered the ability to capture when a script exited with `Exit 1` and handle that accordingly. However that really has never been a recommended scenario for returning errors from scripts and is not seen in the wild anywhere so it is believed that those that may be affected are very few.\n\nChecking `$LastExitCode` checks the last executable's exit code when the script specifically does not call `Exit` (which is . This can lead to very perplexing failures, such as running a successful xcopy that exits with `2` and seeing package failures without understanding why. Since it is not typically recommended to call `Exit` to return a value from PowerShell because of issues with different hosts, it's less of a concern to only look at explicit failures. For folks that may need it, allow failing a package again by the last external command exit code or `exit` from a PowerShell script. Note that it is not recommended to use exit with a number to return from PowerShell scripts. Instead you should use `$env:ChocolateyExitCode` or `Set-PowerShellExitCode` (first available in v0.9.10) to ensure proper setting of the exit code.\n\nIf you need the prior behavior, please turn on the feature `scriptsCheckLastExitCode`.\n\n### BUG FIXES\n\n * Fix - chocolateybeforemodify runs after modifying (moving) chocolatey lib package files - see [#995](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/995)\n * Fix - The refreshenv command throws an error about Write-FunctionCallLogMessage when ran in PowerShell on 0.10.2 - see [#996](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/996)\n\n\n## 0.10.2\n\nWe're dubbing this the \"Every Joe\" release in honor of a friend that just lost his fight with brain cancer. If you want to help further research, please make a donation to a cancer research association of your choosing (e.g. the [American Brain Tumor Assocation](http://www.abta.org/thank-you.html)).\n\nA couple of important fixes/enhancements in this release. Most of the improvements are about providing better feedback to you and fixing minor issues. The big one surrounds when packages set a download path for a file using `$env:TEMP`, choco will ensure that the file can still be found for later use.\n\n### BUG FIXES\n\n* Fix - Downloaded file is at old `$env:TEMP\\chocolatey\\chocolatey` location, but install calls with just `$env:TEMP\\chocolatey\\` location - see [#969](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/969)\n* Fix - [Pro/Business] UseOriginalLocation fails when there is no 64bit file - see [#972](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/972)\n* Fix - Do not use unparsed options as package names - see [#983](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/983)\n\n### IMPROVEMENTS\n\n* Start-ChocolateyProcessAsAdmin enhancements - see [#977](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/977)\n* Log PowerShell function calls better - see [#976](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/976)\n* Allow environment variables in some config settings - see [#971](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/971)\n* [Pro/Business] Provide license type to environment variables - see [#968](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/968)\n* Note that chocolateyUninstall.ps1 may no longer required in template - see [#982](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/982)\n* Provide guidance when licensed only options are passed to FOSS - see [#984](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/984)\n* Rollback automatically when a user cancels an operation - see [#985](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/985)\n* Explain how to workaround a failing uninstall - see [#573](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/573)\n* Remove extra forward slashes in url - see [#986](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/986)\n* Side by side uninstall enhancements - see [#992](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/992)\n\n\n## 0.10.1\n\nWe're dubbing this the \"Shhh! Keep that secret please\" release. We've found that when passing in passwords and other sensitive arguments, those items can end up in the logs in clear text. We've addressed this in [#948](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/948) and [#953](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/953). When it comes to passing sensitive arguments through to native installers, you can set up environment variables with those sensitive args and pass those arguments directly through to `Start-ChocolateyProcessAsAdmin`. If you prefer a better experience, the licensed version allows passing sensitive options directly through choco.exe as `--install-arguments-sensitive` and `--package-parameters-sensitive`. Read more in the [Licensed CHANGELOG](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/blob/master/CHANGELOG_LICENSED.md).\n\nPerhaps the biggest improvement in this release is that Chocolatey will automatically look to see if it can download binaries over HTTPS when provided an HTTP url. If so, Chocolatey will switch to downloading the binaries over SSL. This provides better security in downloading and knowing you are getting the binary from the source location instead of a possible man in the middle location, especially when the package does not provide checksums for verification.\n\nAnother improvement you may not even notice, but we think you will love is that Chocolatey now supports TLS v1.2 transport which presents a nice transparent increase in security. You will need to have at least .NET Framework 4.5 installed to take advantage of this feature.\n\n### FEATURES\n\n * [Security] Support TLS v1.2 - see [#458](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/458)\n * [Security] Attempt to download packages via HTTPS connection - see [#746](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/746)\n * [Security] Pro/Business - Pass sensitive arguments to installers - see [#948](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/948)\n * Search (and info) by version - see [#935](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/935)\n\n### BUG FIXES\n\n * [Security] Fix - Passwords in command line options are logged in clear text - see [#953](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/953)\n * [Security] Fix - For PowerShell v2 - if switch down to SSLv3 protocol fails, go back to original protocol - see [#958](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/958)\n * Fix - Unzipping to ProgramFiles/System32 is Subject to File System Redirection - see [#960](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/960)\n * Fix - Run without login - see [#945](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/945)\n * Fix - Support Long Paths - see [#934](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/934)\n * Fix - help should not issue warning about elevated command shell - see [#893](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/893)\n * Fix - Licensed Feed cannot be disabled - see [#959](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/959)\n * Fix - Choco with unknown command should show help menu - see [#938](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/938)\n * Fix - Get-FtpFile error when file is missing (called through Get-ChocolateyWebFile) - see [#920](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/920)\n * Fix - Skip Get-WebFileName for FTP - see [#957](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/957)\n * Fix - Chocolatey-InstallChocolateyPackage fix for double chocolatey folder name is not also applied to the passed in file name - see [#908](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/908)\n * Fix - Start-ProcessAsAdmin - working directory should be from the location of the executable - see [#937](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/937)\n * [POSH Host] Fix - PowerShell Host - Package scripts setting values can affect packages that depend on them - see [#719](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/719)\n * Fix - Transactional install - pending check may fail if the lib folder doesn't exist - see [#954](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/954)\n * Fix - Start-ChocolateyProcessAsAdmin Module Import for PowerShell causes errors - see [#901](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/901)\n\n### IMPROVEMENTS\n\n * Transactional Install - Improve concurrent operations (pending) - see [#943](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/943)\n * Uninstall-ChocolateyPackage should set unrecognized fileType to exe - see [#964](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/964)\n * Powershell functions - Allow access to package title, not only ID - see [#925](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/925)\n * Option to apply package parameters / install arguments to dependent packages - see [#839](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/839)\n * Get-ChocolateyWebFile download check enhancements - see [#952](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/952)\n * Do not treat unknown checksum types as MD5 - see [#932](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/932)\n * Pro/Business - Install-ChocolateyPackage - UseOriginalLocation - see [#950](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/950)\n * Auto determine checksum type - see [#922](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/922)\n * Ensure PowerShell functions have parameter name parity - see [#941](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/941)\n * Output from installer should go to verbose log - see [#940](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/940)\n\n\n## 0.10.0\n\nWhat was planned for 0.9.10.4 is now 0.10.0. This is due partly to a breaking change we are making for security purposes and a move to provide better a better versioning scheme for the remainder of the sub-v1 versions of Chocolatey. Instead of 0.y.z.0 being considered where major verions occur in the sub 1 series, 0.y.0 will now be considered where those major versions occur. We also are moving right along towards v1 (and hope to be there in 2017).\n\n0.10.0 carries the fixes for 0.9.10.4 and includes a major security enhancement (checksum requirement).\n\n### BREAKING CHANGES\n\n * [Security] Checksum requirement and enhancements - see [#112](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/112)\n\nChecksums in package scripts are meant as a measure to validate the originally intended downloaded resources used in the creation of a package are the same files that are received at a future date. This also ensures that the same files that are checked by all parts of moderation (if applicable) are the same files that are received by users for a package. This is seen mostly on the community repository because it is public and packages are subject to copyright laws (distribution rights), which typically requires the package scripts to download software from the official distribution locations. The Chocolatey framework has had the ability to use checksums in package scripts since [July 2014](https://chocolatey.org/packages/chocolatey/0.9.8.24#releasenotes).\n\n**What is the requirement?** choco will now fail if a package download resources from HTTP/FTP and does not use checksums to verify those downloaded resources. The requirement for HTTP/FTP is [#112](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/112). We are considering also requiring it for [HTTPS (#895)](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/895) as well. You can optionally set a feature (`allowEmptyChecksumsSecure`) to ensure packages using HTTPS also use checksums.\n\n**How does this protect the community anymore than before?** During moderation review, there is a check of these downloaded binaries against VirusTotal (which verifies these binaries against 50-60+ different virus scanners). The binaries are also verified for installation purposes against a test computer. With an independent 3rd party checksum in the package itself, it guarantees that the files received by a user from those remote sources are the exact same files that were used in the verification process.\n\n**Why the requirement, and why now?** This is a measure of protection for the Chocolatey community. HTTP is easy to hack with both DNS poisoning and MITM (man in the middle) attacks. Without independent verification of the integrity of the downloaded resources, users can be left susceptible to these issues. We've been planning a move to require checksums for awhile now, with a planned longer and smoother transition for package maintainers to get packages updated to reduce breakages. Unfortunately there was a recent event with [FOSSHub getting hacked](http://www.audacityteam.org/compromised-download-partner/) (the [community repository had 8 possibly affected packages](http://us8.campaign-archive1.com/?u=86a6d80146a0da7f2223712e4&id=f2fe8dbe6b) and [we quickly took action](http://us8.campaign-archive1.com/?u=86a6d80146a0da7f2223712e4&id=2cbe87d486)), which necessitated a need for us to move in a much swifter fashion to ensure the protection of the community sooner, rather than later. The changes in Chocolatey represented by the checksum changes are a major step in the process to ensure protection. Requiring for HTTPS as well will mitigate any future compromises of software distribution sites that are used with Chocolatey packages.\n\n**Can I shut this behavior off or opt out per package?**\nYou can shut off the checksum requirement by enabling the feature `allowEmptyChecksums`. This will return Chocolatey to previous behavior. We strongly recommend against it.\n\nYou can shut it off or turn it per package install/upgrade with `--allow-empty-checksums` and `--require-checksums`, respectively. See https://chocolatey.org/docs/commands-install / https://chocolatey.org/docs/commands-upgrade.\n\nYou can also disable the feature `allowEmptyChecksumsSecure` to enforce checksums for packages that download from secure locations (HTTPS).\n\n**Other things I should know?** Users also now have the ability to pass their own checksums and checksumtypes into the install. See https://chocolatey.org/docs/commands-install / https://chocolatey.org/docs/commands-upgrade.\n\n### KNOWN ISSUES\n\n * [Known Issues](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/labels/Bug)\n\n### FEATURES\n\n * Pro/Business -

With the release of 0.9.10 (or if you prefer 0.9.10.0), we're about to make everything 100% better in your Windows package management world. We've addressed over 100 features and bugs in this release. We looked at how we could improve PowerShell and we've come out with a [competely internal host](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/8) that can Prompt and Read-Host in a way that times out and selects default values after a period of time. Speaking of PowerShell, how about some tab completion `choco <tab>` to `choco install node<tab>`? How about never having to [close and reopen your shell again](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/664)?\n\nAlternative sources (`-source webpi`, `-s windowsfeature`, etc) are back! I mean, am I right?! Have you heard of auto uninstaller? If Chocolatey has installed something that works with Programs and Features, Chocolatey knows how to uninstall it without an uninstall script about 90+% of the time. This feature was in beta for the 0.9.9 series, it is on by default in 0.9.10 (unless you disabled it after trying it, you will need to reenable it, see `choco feature` for more details).\n\nHere's one you probably never knew existed - extensions. Chocolatey has had the ability to extend itself by adding PowerShell modules for years, and most folks either didn't know it existed or have never used them. We've enhanced them a bit in preparation for the licensed version of Chocolatey.\n\nWe redesigned our `choco new` default packaging template and we've made managing templates as easy as managing packages.\n\n`choco search`/`choco list` has so many enhancements, you may not need to visit dot org again. [See it in action](https://chocolatey.org/docs/commands-list#see-it-in-action).\n* [search -v provides moderation related information and a world of nuspec information](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/493)\n* [search by id only](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/663)\n* [search by id exact](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/453)\n* [search by approved only, not broken, and/or by download cache](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/670)\n* [sort by version](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/668)\n* [search with paging](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/427)\n\nThere are 150 tickets closed for this release! We've included remediation steps for when a breaking change affects you. Mostly if you have been using Chocolatey in a recommended way, you won't even notice any adverse changes. There are a number of things we thought to highlight, and quite a few security enhancements coming in this release (look for the [Security] tag on the ticket summary).\n\n### BREAKING CHANGES\n\n * Only fail automation scripts (chocolateyInstall.ps1) if the script returns non-zero exit code - see [#445](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/445)\n\nThe 0.9.8 series would only fail a package with terminating errors. The 0.9.9 series took that a bit further and started failing packages if anything wrote to stderr. It turns out that is a bad idea. Only when PowerShell exits with non-zero (which comes with terminating errors) should the package fail due to this. If you need the old behavior of the 0.9.9 series, you can get it back with a switch (`--fail-on-standard-error` and its aliases) and/or a feature flip (`failOnStandardError`).\n\n * Fix - Force reinstall, force upgrade, and uninstall should delete the download cache - see [#590](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/590)\n\nIf you set a custom cache directory for downloads, it will no longer use a \"chocolatey\" subdirectory under that. You may need to make any adjustments if this is going to affect you.\n\n * Exit with the same exit code as the software being installed - see [#512](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/512)\n\nThere are more exit codes from Chocolatey now that indicate success -`0`, `1605`, `1614`, `1641`, and `3010`. You may need to adjust anything you were using that would only check for 0 and nonzero.\nIf you need the previous behavior, be sure to disable the feature `usePackageExitCodes` or use the `--ignore-package-exit-codes` switch in your choco commands.\n\n * PowerShell module functions adjusted for automatic documentation - see [#697](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/697)\n\nIf you were using any of the functions in a non-recommended way or not compliant with the examples, you are going to find breakages in the functions as some of the things that were called out as non-optional are now enforced. This shouldn't affect most folks.\n\n * [Security] Explicit permissions - remove inheritance/lock down to admins - see [#398](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/398)\n\nThis further restricts the default installation location by removing all permissions and inheritance of permissions, explicitly giving Administrator/LocalSystem to Full access, and Users are granted Read and Execute. In prior installations, we ensured Modify access to the installing user, but that has been removed for security reasons. Should you need the previous behavior, set `$env:ChocolateyInstallAllowCurrentUser=\"true\"`.\n\n### KNOWN ISSUES\n\n * [Known Issues](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/labels/Bug)\n\n### FEATURES\n\n * Alternative Sources -
