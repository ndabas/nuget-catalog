  "description": "Gnostice PDFOne .NET is a versatile PDF component suite for .NET developers to implement PDF-related tasks in their applications. PDFOne .NET can create, edit, view, print, search, redact, encrypt, decrypt, digitally sign, merge, split, reorganize, bookmark, annotate, watermark, and stamp PDF documents. PDFOne .NET can also create, edit, delete, fill and flatten PDF form fields. It also has an AJAX-powered Web-Forms PDF viewer component that can display and print PDF documents on any modern browser. PDFOne .NET is based entirely on managed code. \n\nPDFOne .NET does all of this without any external PDF software such as Adobe PDF library, Adobe Acrobat Professional or Ghostscript. PDFOne .NET can be used with C#, VB.NET, ASP.NET and other .NET development platforms. \n\nPDFOne components come with hundreds of functions and properties that put immense power in the hands of the developer. They hide the complexity of the PDF format and allows developers to quickly implement PDF-related features.",

  "releaseNotes": "===\nImportant/Breaking changes\n\n- Support for .NET Framework 2.0 is dropped from this release onward. From here on the lowest supported .NET Framework version is 4.0.\n- Support for Visual Studio 2005 and 2008 is dropped from this release onward. From here on the lowest supported Visual Studio version is 2010.\n- Starting from this release the product version numbering system has been changed to follow the {YYYY} {Rn} pattern where YYYY is the year of the release and n is the release number for the given year. Note that the assemblies will be versioned as {YY}.{n}.{internal-revision}.{build-counter}\n\n===\nEnhancements\n\nPDF Processing\n- Replaced the existing DCT image decoder with a faster one.\n- Introduced CheckAndFixContentStream boolean property on PDFDocument class which checks that all the stored graphics operators are being closed. If they are not closed then the required number of restored graphic state operators will be added in the content stream.\n- Implemented support for PostScript calculator function (Function type 4) which is one of the color transform functions for processing of certain ColorSpaces.\n\nPDF Creation\n- Added an overloaded WriteText method to write the text with specified character spacing between the characters using the CharacterSpacing property of PDFTextFormatter.\n- Setting the PDFFormComboBox.SelectedItemIndex does not change the selected value in the saved PDF.\n\n===\nFixes\n\nPDF Processing\n- Very slow processing of PDF containing DCT encoded images.\n- Blank output is produced when rendering a PDF containing an image with DeviceGray ColorSpace and SMask.\n- Throws IndexOutOfRangeException while loading some PDF documents when the file contains NUL bytes after EOF.\n- Inline image with ColorSpace CMYK throws IndexOutOfRangeException due to lesser number of bytes in the source image.\n- Inline image with CS as resource name was not handled.\n- 1-D barcodes not appearing in print of the PDF file.\n- Incorrect positioning of page contents when printing PDF file.\n- Throws PDFException: \"Incorrect offset found for object number ...\" while loading faulty PDF documents containing white spaces or junk characters at BOF and incorrect offsets for the objects in the XRef table.\n- Incorrect text rendered for embedded TrueType CID fonts having CFF based glyphs when Encoding data and Predefined Charset data are not specified in the font.\n- Support for faulty PDF documents that contain content/image streams compressed using ASCIIHexDecode filter for which \"End Of Data\" marker (i.e., the character '>') is missing at the end of the stream.\n- Throws NullReferenceException while retrieving bookmarks or Link annotations with GoTo action for which the destination page is specified as 'null'.\n\nPDF Creation\n- TextRise and Character spacing values are now written according to the English locale cultureinfo in order to avoid culture related conversion issues.\n- Adding an image to a pdf with ColorSpace set to CMYK was creating a corrupted pdf.\n\n===\nMiscellaneous\n\n- Removed reference to BouncyCastle crypto libraries.\n- Updated log4net to version 2.0.14.",
