  "description": "Fully managed library providing five types of heap. It implements d-ary, binary, binomial, fibonacci and pairing heaps, in order to let the user choose the best heap to fit her needs. Each heap has its own advantages and disadvantages: please see the documentation or Wikipedia to better understand how those data structures work and how they behave in each operation.\n      NOTICE: If you need more performance, please have a look at the Hippie.Unchecked package. It is a release where all integrity checks have been stripped away.",

  "releaseNotes": "* Fixed a bug in binomial heap.\n      * More unit tests (which, of course, are not shipped with this package).\n      * Implemented methods to get the forest underlying the heap itself. Those methods should be used to study the structure of the heap, maybe with the help of a graphical tester (we are planning to implement it).",
