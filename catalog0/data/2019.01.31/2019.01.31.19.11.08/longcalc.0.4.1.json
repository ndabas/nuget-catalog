  "releaseNotes": "Unsigned Assembly\n\nWith this version, the bf 'twoexp' parameter has been made of type 'mpz_t'. x.Exp will return results for x less or equal 1.e+1035 and a restriction on x.Exp that x be no more than 1.0e+1035 has been implemented. x.Gamma will return results for x less or equal 1.e+1031.\n\nThere is a new x.toString function with a parameter which permits to 'Prettify' the output's exponent.\n\nPublic function outputs for this version as well as 0.3.23.0 are Truncate'd to 4 decimal digits + the applicable Precision. This is essentially 2 base 64 digits' worth, and permits more reliable rounding in the .toString and .Round functions.\n\nAlthough the magnitude of possible outputs from various functions in this version, as well as the flexibility of the mpz_t twoexp, might lead one to believe that nearly any supported operation is possible with this version, such is not the case. For example, users will likely have to check their inputs for any use of the bf x.Add or x.Subtract functions. This version provides no such checks. An attempt like (for x = 1.0e+1035) 'x.Exp().Add(1)' is not trivial since performing the Add function would require one addend's shift by a garagantuan amount, an operation beyond the scope of most computers and likely the software as well, even if the addend's mantissa is relatively short. The likely outcome is for the computer to exhaust all available memory and/or cache space before bringing that machine to an impasse.\n\nChecks for arithmetic overflow or underflow are again compiler-included in this release.",

  "summary": "This library, built with and accessible by Visual Studio (2017) and using Mpir.net for the underlying integer math, supplies a variety of math functions and utilities with precisions at least as large as 2,000,000 base 10 digits. The underlying objects are bf (for 'big float' real values comprised of an mpz_t extended integer part from Mpir.net and a base 2 int64 exponent), bcr (for complex numbers expressed in the rectangular coordinates of a bf real part and a bf imaginary part), and bcp (for complex numbers expressed in the polar coordinates of a bf radius and a bf angle). Functions supported include real and complex versions of: basic arithmetic, trigonometric functions, log and exponential functions, hyperbolic functions and the inverses of all of these, base conversions between bases up to 64, conversions between rectangular and polar coordinates, and some special functions such as Euler, Bernoulli, Gamma, Zeta, and BesselJ.",
