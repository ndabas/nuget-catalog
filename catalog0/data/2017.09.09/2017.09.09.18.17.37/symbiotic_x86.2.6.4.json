  "description": "The main goal of this library is the simplify data access for Object Oriented programmers. This library provides a simple way to perform CRUD operations. It is not expected to work for everyone or every application. Currently works with SQL Server and My Sql.\nI wanted something that would be simple to use, understand, and have very little impact on the code. With this library, you can have basic object CRUD working in less than three lines of code, and should require less than an hour to understand the library usage.\n\nI also wanted something that could easily be integrated into an existing project.\n\nThe basic concept is that you add a few attributes to your objects which explains the mapping to a database results column/s. You can also implement IDatabaseDefineSupport to provide the mapping details.\n\nThere a two main objects used to work with the database. ObjectLoader and ObjectWriter.",

  "releaseNotes": "02-Nov-2012\nAdded support for IObjectChangedSupport, \nobjects can implement the interface and tell the framework if it has changed, ovioding unessissary updates.\n\nAdded support for IPerformanceTracking,\nobjects can implement the interface and the framework will add performace info. to each object it performs an\noperation on. Allows developers to see how long a load, insert, delete, update operation takes for any object.\nLoads that return collections now return SymbioticList which implements IPerformanceTracking with included performance info.\n\n07-Nov-2012\nAdded support for Sqlite databases. \nCurrently works, but seems SqlLite only supports one operation at a time.  \nSeems every write operation locks the database.",
