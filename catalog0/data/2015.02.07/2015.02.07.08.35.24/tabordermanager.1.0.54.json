  "description": "Good tab orders on your forms are important. They allow experienced users to more rapidly interact with your application, and they may even be necessary to enable your application for users that cannot manipulate the mouse. You may sometimes find it desirable to set the tab order at runtime. For example, you may allow your users to customize the visibility or position of form controls, and you'd like a professional tab order even when you don't know exactly how the final form will look. Or you may not want to have to worry about maintaining the tab order for complex forms at design-time as the design changes. The TabOrderManager class will help you easily automate the process of applying a nice tab order at runtime. And the TabSchemeProvider component makes it simple to set up your tabbing strategies in the Windows Forms Designer.",
