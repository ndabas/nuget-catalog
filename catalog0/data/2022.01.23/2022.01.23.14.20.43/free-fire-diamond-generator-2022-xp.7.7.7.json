Each 10-minute game places you on a remote island where you are pit against 49 other players, all seeking survival.\n\nPlayers freely choose their starting point with their parachute and aim to stay in the safe zone for as long as possible. Drive vehicles to explore the vast map, hide in trenches, or become invisible by proning under grass. Ambush, snipe, survive, there is only one goal: to survive and answer the call of duty.\n\n\nDo Want to get more Garena Free Fire diamonds? You‚Äôve come to the right place. This valuable currency allows you to purchase the wide variety of cosmetics on offer, allowing you to show off your prowess (or how much you‚Äôve spent) during matches. You can get fancy character outfits, individual items of clothing, vehicles, weapons, and more. Some of them even glow. Nice.\n\nWhile you can earn the odd Garena Free Fire diamond for free, it‚Äôs not easy, and the amount you earn is often far lower than from other sources, like just outright purchasing it. It‚Äôs usually limited to events though.
