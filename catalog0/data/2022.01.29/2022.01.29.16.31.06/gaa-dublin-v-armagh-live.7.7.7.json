  "description": "The Dublin Senior Football team has been named for this evening’s Allianz League Round 1 tie against Armagh at Croke Park (7.30pm- live on RTÉ 2).\n\nClick Here To Watch: https://allsport247.blogspot.com/2022/01/gaa.html\n\nClick Here To Watch: https://allsport247.blogspot.com/2022/01/gaa.html\n \nArmagh begin their 2022 Division One campaign this weekend with the toughest possible assignment.\nKieran McGeeney's men travel to Croke Park to face Dublin in the Allianz National League opener and the game has been scheduled for live coverage.\n\nWhile Dessie Farrell's Dubs relinquished their All-Ireland title last summer after an unprecedented six-in-a-row, they have started 2022 like a house on fire.\n\nWith big guns like Ciaran Kilkenny involved from the start, they blazed a trail through the O'Byrne Cup and lifted the title last week after beating Laois in the final.\n\nNow their attention turns to the National League and a clash with Armagh up first.\nArmagh travel south to take on Dublin today in the first game of the new season in the National Football League Division 1.\n\nLast year, Armagh retained their Division 1 status despite finishing in the bottom two of their group and they then defeated Roscommon in a relegation playoff.\n\nDue to the Covid-19 crisis having a major impact on GAA, Dublin and Kerry split the National Football League championship last season.\n\nDublin are heavy favourites for this one but could the Orchard County cause an upset at Croke Park?\nHere's all you need to know ahead of the game:",
