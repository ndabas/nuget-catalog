  "description": "Dessie Farrell wasn’t especially happy with the O’Byrne Cup win over Laois and will be giving plenty of lads chances. Lee Gannon looks likely to feature at the back and Ciarán Archer gets the chance to start graduating from under-20 stardom. Armagh finally get a crack at one of the rites of Division One, playing Dublin in Croke Park – a good stage for Rian O’Neill but maybe not so good for a typically open defence.\n\nClick HEre: https://allsport247.blogspot.com/2022/01/gaa.html\n\nClick HEre: https://allsport247.blogspot.com/2022/01/gaa.html\n\nDivision Two\nDerry v Down, Owenbeg, 6pm [Live, BBC app/Sport NI website]\n\nDerry aim to complete a three-season run from Division Four to the top and build on last year’s encouraging championship. Down appear a little unready for the start of season with injuries and club ties but have Ulster-winning under-20s to import. Likely to learn more than they earn here.\n\nDivision Three\nLimerick v Longford, TUS Gaelic Grounds, 5pm\n\nLimerick appeared a little out of sorts getting beaten by Tipp in the McGrath Cup, squandering chances and losing Brian Fanning for the season. Longford look purposeful and may fancy themselves here.\n\nFermanagh v Antrim, Brewster Park, 7pm\n\nAntrim have been buoyant under Enda McGinley and are back in this division whereas the home side’s former captain Eoin Donnelly has retired. Fermanagh may be under pressure here.\n\nDivision Four\nCarlow v London, Netwatch Cullen Park, 7pm\n\nWelcome back for London after the guts of two years lost to Covid-19 although Carlow unlikely to see it that way.\n\nWalsh Cup SH final\nDublin v Wexford, Croke Park, 5.30pm\n\nDublin have had a bounce in their step to date and Wexford under new management will be interesting and can start with a trophy this evening.\n\nAll-Ireland club SFC semi-finals\nKilcoo (Down) v St Finbarrs (Cork), MW Hire O’Moore Park, 3pm [Live TG4]",
