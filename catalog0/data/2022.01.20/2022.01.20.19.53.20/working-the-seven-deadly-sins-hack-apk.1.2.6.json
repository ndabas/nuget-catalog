Sin is deadly. As Romans 6:23 tells us, \"For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.\" But why are particular sins known as the \"Seven Deadly Sins\"? Let's look at the historical and biblical context of this well-known phrase.\n\nDefinition of Sin Sin is defined as \"an offense against the religious or moral law\" and a \"transgression of the law of God.\" The biblical terminology of sin suggests that sin has three aspects: disobedience to or breach of the law, violation of relationships with people, and rebellion against God, which is the most basic concept.\n\nWhat are the 7 Deadly Sins? The seven deadly sins, as identified by Pope Gregory 1 in the late sixth century, are considered categories of sin:\n\nPride, Envy, Wrath, Gluttony, Lust, Sloth, and Greed. Many think the deadly seven are recorded in the Bible. Surprisingly, even though each of the seven is a sin, this list is not contained in Scripture. The history of this sin categorization began in the year 400.\n\nEvagrius Ponticus a fourth-century monk, described eight evils to resist. Two centuries later Pope Gregory 1, refined the inventory to seven. Almost every sin can be placed in one of these seven categories. Isaiah 14:13-14 tells us pride and selfishness are related to each of the seven and are viewed as the root causes of all sin.\n\nThe Seven Deadly Sins in the Bible Throughout the sweep of the Scripture, these seven specific sins are addressed. Perhaps Exodus, Deuteronomy, Proverbs, and Galatians are some places where the deadly sins were identified.\n\nThe 10 Commandments (Exodus 20 and Deuteronomy 5)\n\nYou shall have no other Gods before me. 2. Don’t make an idol. 3. Don’t take the Lord’s name in vain. 4",
