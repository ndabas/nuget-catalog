  "releaseNotes": "Corrected a problem which occurred in the earlier version in which complex-valued objects 'bcp' were not always normalized to have angle between 0 and two * Pi upon object initialization.\n\nCorrected a problem in which bf x.Power(exponent) sometimes returned a negative value even though the exponent was an integer and even.\n\nCorrected a problem in which results were not always properly rounded in the toString function outputs. \n\nMade some corrections and adjustments to real and complex-valued Zeta function procedures.\n\nThe public functions which produced bf, bcr, or bcp objects and require a Precision setting (either explicitly or implicitly) now produce results with outputs truncated to no more than (Precision + 4) significant digits to permit proper rounding to Precision digits in the toString function outputs.\n\nIncluded compiler-added checks for arithmetic overflow or underflow of int, long, double, etc data types.\n\nWith this revision, the twoexp (bf object two's exponent) is a long (Int64) variable. Also, Precisions (which are always represented as number of decimal digits) are specifically limited to no more than 323,000,000 digits. This is not much less than the natural limitation on precisions when multiplying the underlying mpz_t objects.\n\nAn effort has been made to check for overflows of the underlying mpz_t object when performing a bf 'Add' function. If an overflow were to occur, the user can set the bf.GlobalAllowAddTruncates flag to 'true' to allow the software objects to behave more like true 'floating-point' variables in which truncation of results of adds occurs on underflow or overflow of mantissa. \n\nMany integers less than the maximum value of a bf object, which is ((2 ^ (int.MaxValue - 1)) - 1) * (2 ^ (long.MaxValue)), are not representable by this software. As a result, the bf Floor() function returns an error when applied to bf objects greater than the maximum mpz_t object, which is (2 ^ (int.MaxValue - 1) - 1).",

  "summary": "This library, built with and accessible by Visual Studio (2017) and using Mpir.net for the underlying integer math, supplies a variety of math functions and utilities with precisions at least as large as 2,000,000 base 10 digits. The underlying objects are bf (for 'big float' real values comprised of an mpz_t extended integer part from Mpir.net and a base 2 int64 exponent), bcr (for complex numbers expressed in the rectangular coordinates of a bf real part and a bf imaginary part), and bcp (for complex numbers expressed in the polar coordinates of a bf radius and a bf angle). Functions supported include real and complex versions of: basic arithmetic, trigonometric functions, log and exponential functions, hyperbolic functions and the inverses of all of these, base conversions between bases up to 64, conversions between rectangular and polar coordinates, and some special functions such as Euler, Bernoulli, Gamma, Zeta, and BesselJ.",
