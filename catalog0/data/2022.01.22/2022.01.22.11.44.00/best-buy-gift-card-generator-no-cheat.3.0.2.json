That makes them a very convenient gift to give and receive at the holidays.\n\nBut their wide availability also comes with some dangers, with gift card scams becoming more common. While acquiring gift cards at valid locations and sites is safe (since cards are activated upon checkout), you should always avoid websites that advertise as a \"gift code generator\" or anything like it. That's a false claim and a phishing tactic.\n\nAnd then there are third-party gift card websites offering to buy from and sell to consumers, which is where it gets tricky.

Before you finish holiday shopping or try to return unwanted gift cards in your wallet, read on for ways to keep your money and identity safe.\n\nRead more: Are you being scammed?
