  "description": "How to gift-wrap Venmo payments\n\n🔥🔥VISIT HERE🔴►► https://gamecodeclaim.com/c/venmo/\n\n🔥🔥VISIT HERE🔴►► https://gamecodeclaim.com/c/venmo/\n\nGetting a gift of cash via Venmo is great — infinitely better than a gift card — but it’s hard to get appropriately excited and grateful about a row of numbers sandwiched between a rent payment and your share of last night’s pizza tab.\n\nSo starting Thursday you can “wrap” your Venmo gift payments. It's still all in the app, but instead of the usual notification of fresh funds in your account it'll be more festive — even if it's not your birthday or a holiday. The idea came about after Venmo noticed during the pandemic that more people (almost 60 percent of current customers) were gifting money through Venmo with notes that said things like, \"thanks\" or \"just because,\" as a Venmo rep explained in an email. Clearly, Venmo payments were becoming little expressions of love, so gift-wrapping was born.\n\nThere are eight different gift-wrap designs with animations to amp up your cute and clever GIF- and emoji-filled note. To send a gift-wrapped Venmo payment you still click the same \"Pay or Request\" button on the home screen and proceed as usual with a recipient, note, and amount. But before sending it off, you'll notice a new gift-wrap icon next to the \"Pay\" button. It'll be a free feature when it rolls out to American users Thursday.\n\nIf you’re a fan of online person-to-person payment apps, you may wonder, “Do prepaid cards work on Venmo?” They do, and therein lies an interesting story that we’ll address in this article, along with a review of the best prepaid cards to use.\n\nA reloadable prepaid card account is a valuable financial alternative to a credit card and to a debit card or cash card tied to your bank account. Prepaid cards provide a cash substitute for purchases without creating debt, interest payments, or the need for a bank account. One thing prepaid cards don’t help with is building your credit score sinc",
