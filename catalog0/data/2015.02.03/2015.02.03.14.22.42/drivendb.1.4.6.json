  "releaseNotes": "Added a few test to confirm existing functionality.  Removed type constraint on Write methods as they were extraneous and annoying.  Added identity check option on merge methods to enable merging of entities with different identities.  Laid some ground work for reading and writing aggregate entities. Updated schema generator to default with better options.",
  "requireLicenseAcceptance": false,
  "summary": "Features Include: \n* Self-Tracking entities that maintain their state through WCF serialization.\n* Bulk reads / writes to the database reducing round trips.\n* Parallel reads for decreasing load time of large result sets.\n* Easily use your current Linq classes or the included entity generator.\n* Support classes provide easy caching and filtered in-memroy views that are always up-to-date.\n* Weak event model reduces memory leaks and eliminates the need for IDisposable implementations.",
