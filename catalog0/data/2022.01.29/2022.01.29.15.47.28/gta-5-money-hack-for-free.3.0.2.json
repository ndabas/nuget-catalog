We've tested each code ourselves, dozens of times, so you know they'll work.

Cheats are a fun way to play because you don't have to worry about getting items the usual way. Instead of exploring the map in search of a vehicle or weapon, you can enter a cheat code and jump straight into the action.\n\nThe only cheat you won't find here is an \"infinite money cheat\" because money is something you have to get on your own in GTA 5. We suggest checking out our guide on how to make money in GTA 5 if you're looking for money-making tips.",
