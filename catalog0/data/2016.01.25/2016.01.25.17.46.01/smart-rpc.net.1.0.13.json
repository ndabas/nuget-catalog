  "releaseNotes": "- Issue with the disconnection of the client manager. The disconnected event was not fired.\n- Issue when executing an action or method via the client manager on an inactive connection. The action/method would fail with a timeout instead of a communication problem. This interfered with the reconnect mechanism provided by the ServiceAdapterBase.\n- The ServiceAdapterBase will call the OnConnecting / OnConnected methods when a ClientManager is provided which already has an active connection with the remote side.",
