  "releaseNotes": "- Added support for utilizing the Microsoft Graph API to access files from both Consumer OneDrive as well as OneDrive for Business sites through 1 unified authentication process\n- Changed the default limit for deciding between the Simple Upload and Resumable Upload from 5 MB to 4 MB as per Microsoft recommendations\n- All methods in the base OneDrive class are now virtual so you can easily override them in your inherited code if you wish to do so\n- Added methods to query for basic SharePoint Online site data as exposed by the Graph API v1.0. Only the beta of the Graph API supports working with list items and files on SharePoint Online. As the beta is not intended for production use, I haven't implemented these methods.",
