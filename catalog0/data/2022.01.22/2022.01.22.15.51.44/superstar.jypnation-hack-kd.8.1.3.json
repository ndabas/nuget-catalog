The internet as we know it today wasn’t developed by any one single entity but built collaboratively around open standards and protocols including notably net neutrality. Whether such principles would govern this would-be internet successor is a topic of debate. If any company were able to consolidate power over the Metaverse’s formation and become its de facto gatekeeper the control they could wield over the dissemination of information and in setting their own commercial and security practices would be enormous.\nSuperStar JYPNATION is one of the biggest games out there right now when it comes to creativity and creation allowing players to create their own little games using the SuperStar JYPNATION Studio engine. If you’re looking to become one of those creative players but aren’t sure about the price point you may be asking yourself whether or not you can play SuperStar JYPNATION for free.\nThe term originated in Neal Stephenson’s 1992 novel Snow Crash the story of a pizza delivery rider who spends his free time escaping his daily life by plugging into the Metaverse – a simulated world which allows its denizens to live as whoever they designed their avatars to be in a shared reality which is always on and beyond the control of any one user.\n",
