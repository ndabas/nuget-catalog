  "description": "# EventFlow\n\n![EventFlow logo](./icon-128.png)\n\n```\n$ dotnet add package EventFlow\n```\n\nEventFlow is a basic CQRS+ES framework designed to be easy to use.\n\nHave a look at our [getting started guide](https://docs.geteventflow.net/GettingStarted.html),\nthe [do’s and don’ts](https://docs.geteventflow.net/DosAndDonts.html) and the\n[FAQ](https://docs.geteventflow.net/FAQ.html).\n\n## Features\n\n* **Easy to use**: Designed with sensible defaults and implementations that make it\n  easy to create an example application\n* **Highly configurable and extendable**: EventFlow uses interfaces for every part of\n  its core, making it easy to replace or extend existing features with custom\n  implementation\n* **No use of threads or background workers**\n* **MIT licensed** Easy to understand and use license for enterprise\n\n## Versions\n\nDevelopment of version 1.0 has started and is mainly braking changes regarding changes\nrelated to replacing EventFlow types with that of Microsoft extension abstractions,\nmainly `IServiceProvider` and `ILogger<>`.\n\nThe following list key characteristics of each version as well as its related branches\n(not properly configured yet).\n\n* `1.x`\n\n  Represents the next iteration of EventFlow that aligns EventFlow with the standard\n  packages for .NET (Core). Releases here will only support .NET Standard, .NET Core\n  and .NET versions going forward.\n\n  - Released\n  - Still development\n  - Not all projects migrated yet\n  \n  Read the [migration guide](./MIGRATION_GUIDE.md) to view the full list of breaking\n  changes as well as recommendations on how to migrate.\n\n  ### Documentation (not complete)\n  Version 1.x documentation has been pulled into this repository in order to have\n  the code and documentation closer together and (hopefully) have the documentation\n  updated in the same pull-requests as any code changes.\n\n  ### NuGet package status\n\n  - 🟢 ported\n  - 💚 newly added to 1.0\n  - 🟠 not yet ported to 1.0\n  - 💀 for packages that are removed as part of 1.0 (see the [migration guide](./MIGRATION_GUIDE.md) for details)\n\n  Projects\n    - 🟢 `EventFlow`\n    - 🟠 `EventFlow.AspNetCore`\n    - 💀 `EventFlow.Autofac`\n    - 💀 `EventFlow.DependencyInjection`\n    - 🟠 `EventFlow.Elasticsearch`\n    - 🟠 `EventFlow.EntityFramework`\n    - 🟠 `EventFlow.EventStores.EventStore`\n    - 🟢 `EventFlow.Hangfire`\n    - 🟢 `EventFlow.MongoDB`\n    - 🟢 `EventFlow.MsSql`\n    - 💀 `EventFlow.Owin`\n    - 🟢 `EventFlow.PostgreSql`\n    - 💚 `EventFlow.Redis`\n    - 🟠 `EventFlow.RabbitMQ`\n    - 🟢 `EventFlow.Sql`\n    - 🟠 `EventFlow.SQLite`\n    - 🟢 `EventFlow.TestHelpers`\n\n  ### Branches\n  - `develop-v1`: Development branch, pull requests should be done here\n  - `release-v1`: Release branch, merge commits are done to this branch from\n    `develop-v1` to create releases. Typically each commit represents a release\n\n* `0.x` (legacy)\n\n  The current stable version of EventFlow and has been the version of EventFlow\n  for almost six years. 0.x versions have .NET Framework support and limited\n  support to the Microsoft extension packages through extra NuGet packages.\n\n  Feature and bug fix releases will still be done while there's interest in\n  the community.\n\n  ### Branches\n  - `develop-v0`: Development branch, pull requests should be done here\n  - `release-v0`: Release branch, merge commits are done to this branch from\n    `develop-v0` to create releases. Typically each commit represents a release\n\n  ### Documentation\n  Version 0.x documentation is (although a bit outdated) is live at\n  https://docs.geteventflow.net/.\n\n\n## Talks directly related to EventFlow\n\n- [GOTO Aarhus 2022](https://github.com/rasmus/presentation-goto-2022) by [rasmus](https://github.com/rasmus)\n  Practical event sourcing using EventFlow",

  "releaseNotes": "Read the complete migration guide to get the full list of changes as well as recommendations\non how to do the migration.\nhttps://github.com/eventflow/EventFlow/blob/develop-v1/MIGRATION_GUIDE.md\n(If you see any changes you feel ownership of and you want you name there, create an issue\nand it will get fixed asap. EventFlow would be where it is today without the grate community\ncontributions that it have received over the years)\nChanges since last 1.x pre-release, `1.0.5003-alpha`\n* New: .NET 8 support\n* New: Enable `IEventStore` to load events to a given sequence number (thanks @SeWaS)\n* New: `EventFlow.Hangfire` now part of the v1 release cycle (thanks @nicolaj-hartmann)\n* Fix/breaking: Switch from `System.Data.SqlClient` to `Microsoft.Data.SqlClient` (thanks @janrybka)\nChanges since last 1.x pre-release, `1.0.5002-alpha`\n* New: Read model rebuilder can be done across multiple read model types. The piping of events\n  and applying them are now done concurrently to reduced memory usage and significantly improve\n  time to completion (by @kyle-bradley)\n* New: Created `EventFlow.Redis` (by @joshua211)\n* New: Migrated `EventFlow.RabbitMQ` to v1 (by @kyle-bradley)\n* Breaking: Removed old `EventFlow.Shims.Tasks` class that provided a wrapper for `Task.CompletedTask`\n  in frameworks that did not have it\nChanges since last 1.x pre-release, `1.0.5001-alpha`\n* New/breaking: `IEventUpgrader<,>` are now (finally) async. For an easy upgrade experience,\n  use the new base class `EventUpgraderNonAsync` for any existing upgraders. Its a `abstract`\n  class that implements the updated interface and provides a `abstract` method with the same\n  signature as the previous interface\n* Fix/breaking: Event upgraders are now used during read model population. As the upgraders\n  are re-used across multiple aggregates, there is a high likelihood that some additions are\n  needed in any existing upgraders. Upgraders are stored on the new `IEventUpgradeContext`,\n  which is created by the new `IEventUpgradeContextFactory`. Replace this if you need addition\n  context during event upgrades\n* Fix: `SnapshotAggregateRoot` now correctly loads previous source IDs as well\n  adds the current source ID that triggered the snapshot. This causes the\n  `DuplicateOperationException` to be correctly thrown if a duplicate source\n  ID as added before a snapshot was taken\n* Fix: Upgrade `Newtonsoft.Json` from `11.0.2` to `13.0.1` to fix DoS\n  vulnerability\n  - https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-5crp-9r3c-p9vr\n  - https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-DOTNET-NEWTONSOFTJSON-2774678\n* Fix: `UseFilesEventPersistence` should no longer throw exception for .NET regarding relative paths\nComplete 1.0 change log\n* New: Read model rebuilder can be done across multiple read model types. The piping of events\n  and applying them are now done concurrently to reduced memory usage and significantly improve\n  time to completion (by @kyle-bradley)\n* New: Created `EventFlow.Redis` (by @joshua211)\n* New/breaking: Replace internal IoC implementation with `Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection`\n* New/breaking: Replace internal logging implementation with `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging`\n* New/breaking: SQL read models now support different connection strings using the\n  `[SqlReadModelConnectionStringName]` attribute. To allow executing queries using different\n  connection strings, all methods on `IMsSqlConnection` and `ISqlConnection` now have an\n  additional argument, `string connectionStringName` to signify which connection string\n  should be used for the query\n* New/breaking: SQL connection strings are now fetched from the\n  `SqlConfiguration<T>.GetConnectionStringAsync(...)` instead of a property, allowing more\n  control of the connection string used at runtime\n* New/breaking: `IEventUpgrader<,>` are now (finally) async. For an easy upgrade experience,\n  use the new base class `EventUpgraderNonAsync` for any existing upgraders. Its a `abstract`\n  class that implements the updated interface and provides a `abstract` method with the same\n  signature as the previous interface\n* New: Its now possible to change the execution timeout for database migrations using the\n  `SetUpgradeExecutionTimeout(...)` on the SQL configuration\n* Fix/breaking: Event upgraders are now used during read model population. As the upgraders\n  are re-used across multiple aggregates, there is a high likelihood that some additions are\n  needed in any existing upgraders. Upgraders are stored on the new `IEventUpgradeContext`,\n  which is created by the new `IEventUpgradeContextFactory`. Replace this if you need addition\n  context during event upgrades\n* Breaking: Removed the following dead and/or confusion MSSQL attributes. The real ones\n  are named the same, with with `Sql...` instead of `MsSql...`\n  - `MsSqlReadModelIdentityColumn`\n  - `MsSqlReadModelIgnoreColumn`\n  - `MsSqlReadModelVersionColumn`\n* Breaking: Methods on `IMsSqlDatabaseMigrator` and `ISqlDatabaseMigrator` have been\n  made async and have an extra `CancellationToken` argument\n* Breaking: Remove support for .NET Framework and consolidate on .NET (Core) LTS versions\n* Breaking: Replace internal in-memory caching with `Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.Memory`\n* Breaking: Removed `IAmAsyncReadModelFor` and made `IAmReadModelFor` async\n* Breaking: Removed `EventFlow.Core.AsyncHelper` as well as all async wrapper methods\n  that used it\n  - `IAggregateStore.Load`\n  - `IAggregateStore.Store`\n  - `IAggregateStore.Update`\n  - `ICommandBus.Publish`\n  - `IEventStore.LoadAggregate`\n  - `IEventStore.LoadEvents`\n  - `IEventStore.LoadAllEvents`\n  - `IQueryProcessor.Process`\n  - `IReadModelPopulator.Populate`\n  - `IReadModelPopulator.Purge`\n* Breaking: Removed old `EventFlow.Shims.Tasks` class that provided a wrapper for `Task.CompletedTask`\n  in frameworks that did not have it\n* Fix: `SnapshotAggregateRoot` now correctly loads previous source IDs as well\n  adds the current source ID that triggered the snapshot.
