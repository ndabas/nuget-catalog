  "description": "Features:\n* The dump output is separated from the targeted dump media by the familiar TextWriter interface.\n* The programmer can dump the value of any type of object: primitive and  enum types (including those marked with FlagsAttribute), custom classes, struct-s, collections, etc.\n* For complex type objects (classes and structs) the dumper outputs the names and the values of the properties.\n* The dump is recursive: the complex members of the dumped object are dumped indented.\n* Dumps the elements of sequences (arrays, lists, dictionaries, etc.)\n* Handles circular references.\n* The developers can easily customize various aspects of the dump by using an attribute (DumpAttribute) on the classes and their members, such as:\n    - the order in which the properties are dumped;\n    - formatting of the property names and/or values;\n    - suppressing the dump of some uninteresting properties;\n    - masking the values of sensitive (e.g. PII) properties;\n    - the depth of the recursion into complex members;\n    - the maximum number of dumped elements of sequence properties.\n* The dumper picks the customization attributes also from buddy classes declared with MetadataTypeAttribute.\n* Even if the class doesn't have any attributes, the programmer can still pass a metadata class as a separate parameter to the dumping method. This allows for control over the dump of BCL and third party classes.\n* Build and tested with .NET 4.0, 4.5, 4.5.1. This package targets .NET 4.0.",
