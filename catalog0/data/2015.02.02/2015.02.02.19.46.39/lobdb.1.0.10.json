  "description": "The main idea of the LoBDb.NET project is to complement the functionality of existing DBMS to some common programming interface that can be accessed with those SQL operators that are implemented identically in all database management products, namely Insert/Select/Update/Delete operators as well as the mechanism of invoking stored procedures.\nThe functionality of a smart database consists of different areas. First of all, LoBDb.NET database stores a physical data model that describes a set of user-defined tables, their columns and indexes.\nSecondly, a LoBDb.NET database provides a one-stage recycle bin that helps administrators restoring deleted records.\nThirdly, the platform provides a built-in security model that controls the data access.\nFourthly, LoBDb.NET extends many built-in DBMS column types.\nFifthly, each user-defined table contains a set of system columns storing such information as the record creation date and time, the record owner etc.",
