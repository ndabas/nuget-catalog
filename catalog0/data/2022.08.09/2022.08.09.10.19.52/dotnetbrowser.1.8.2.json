  "releaseNotes": "DotNetBrowser 1.8.2 comes with the following new features and improvements:\nImplemented C# objects support for JSFunction.Invoke(). In previous versions, only primitive types and DotNetBrowser JS wrappers could be used as parameters. Now it is possible to pass .NET objects as parameters to JavaScript function call. \nAdded ability to specify WebRTC IP handling policy. This allows to prevent exposing of the local IP addresses to servers.\nSimplified embedding for lightweight controls. The previous version allowed embedding lightweight controls from source code only.  Now they can be embedded from Toolbox or XAML directly.\nProperties and events of the BrowserView controls are now available in the Designer.\nDOM API update: now you can attach a single event listener to several DOM events by a single call.\nAdded JavaScript context events. These events can be used to execute any JavaScript code before the web page JavaScript is executed.\nDOM API update: added LINQ support for XPath. Now you can use LINQ expressions to work with nodes returned after evaluating XPath expression.\nImproved performance for saving web page as image in the lightweight mode.\nImproved lightweight rendering performance.\n\nThis version also includes fixes for several issues:\n\nFixed DotNetBrowser crash when handling custom cursors. This issue was reproducible when the custom cursor is detected in Chromium, but no image provided for it.\nFixed several issues in the default context menu implementation.\nFixed ComboBox auto-close issue, which was reproducible when some popup windows were open.\nFixed issue with debugger hanging on public properties evaluation. \n",
