  "releaseNotes": "0.3.3\n=====\n* using log4net logger directly\n* distributing as NuGet package\n\n0.3.2\n=====\n* eliminating some uncaught exceptions in command handling pipeline\n* sync multi command fix (avoid infinite response loop)\n\n0.3.1\n=====\n* Replaced TimeoutException with SocketException(10060) which is the more appropriate socket timeout exception\n\n0.3\n===\n* Replaced IStatsCollector with IClacksInstrumentation for better hooks into current state of the server\n* Fixed various issues that could cause errors under load\n  * New client and server request processing logic\n  * Fixed bad Socket.Listen queue size\n* ConnectionPool\n  * most recently used sockets are now added to the front of the available queue, since they have a higher likelyhood of still being connected\n  * do not check Connected on socket on each pool fetch, since it has significant overhead\n  * Better Connected logic (i.e. polls socket, rather than just use the socket's Connected field)\n  * When the pool is exhausted, incoming requests for sockets are now queue'd for ConnectTimeout rather than failing immediately\n* ClackClient\n  * Added auto-reconnect/retry on request failure (assumes stateless server, can be turned off)\n  * now requires an IConnectionPool, so while host/port & IPEndpoint Ctor's still exist, the ISocket Ctor is gone\n* Added the Client's endpoint to server's Request object",
