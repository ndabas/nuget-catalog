  "description": "Author's note: The library was created back in the earliest days of .NET because I needed a place to accumulate bits of reusable utility code and classes. Over a period of several years the library grew quite large and jumbled as a wide variety of code accumulated inside it. Now in recent years the library has shrunk dramatically as newer .NET Frameworks and Nuget packages with expanded functionality have made of lot of the original library redundant. The code that remains in the current library is somewhat \"geeky\" and contains some interesting sample functionality related to random numbers, cryptography, checksums, maths and ID3 tagged files. The whole library is public just in case it's useful for other developers.",
