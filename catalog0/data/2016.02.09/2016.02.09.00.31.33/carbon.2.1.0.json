  "releaseNotes": "## New Functions\n\n * `Get-HttpUrlAcl`: uses Windows API to return HTTP URL ACLs; replaces the `netsh http show urlacl` command.\n * `Grant-HttpUrlPermission`: uses Windows API to grant listen/delegate permissions on HTTP URLs; replaces the `netsh http add urlacl` command.\n * `Revoke-HttpUrlPermission`: uses Windows API to revoke all a user or group's permissions on HTTP URLs; replaces the `netsh http delete urlacl` command.\n * `Install-Directory`: creates a directory (and any missing parents), if it doesn't exist already. Finally!\n * `Uninstall-Directory`: removes a directory, if it exists. Finally!\n * `Uninstall-Group`: uses the `DirectoryServices.AccountManagement` .NET API to remove a group, if it exists.\n * `Test-GroupMember`: uses the `DirectoryServices.AccountManagemetn` .NET API to test if a principal is a member of a group.\n\n## New DSC Resource\n\n * `Carbon_Group`: resource for configuring local groups.\n \n## Bug Fixes\n \n * Fixed: `Install-FileShare` always re-configures existing shares; it doesn't properly detect permissions that need to be removed.\n * Fixed: `Set-IniEntry` fails to preserve unicode characters with diacritics in INI entry names and values.\n * Fixed: `Remove-IniEntry` fails to preserve unicode characters with diacritics in INI entry names and values.\n * Fixed: `Set-HostsEntry` leaves trailing tabs and whitespace after all but the last line.\n * Fixed: `Get-PowerShellModuleInstallPath` returns wrong path for PowerShell 4.\n * Fixed: `Protect-String` fails when Carbon is installed in a module path that contains spaces ([fixes issue #174](https://bitbucket.org/splatteredbits/carbon/issues/174/protect-string-throws-when-module-path)).\n * Fixed: `New-RsaKeyPair` generates a key pair that isn't supported for encrypting/decrypting DSC credentials or supported by the CMS message cmdlets.\n * Fixed: `Get-ScheduledTask` returns invalid task commands when those commands contain quotes (works around an issue where `schtasks.exe` CSV output can't be parsed correctly by `ConvertFrom-Csv`).\n * Fixed: `Add-GroupMember` and `Remove-GroupMember` fail when adding `Everyone` or `NT Service\\*` accounts to a group ([fixes issue #177](https://bitbucket.org/splatteredbits/carbon/issues/177/add-groupmembers-201-doesnt-like-vsa-names)).\n * Fixed: `Get-SheduledTask` writes an error if a scheduled task's XML definition is for an executable and doesn't contain an arguments element.\n \n## Other Improvements\n\n * Obsolete function parameters will no longer show in Intellisense (added the `DontShow` parameter property).\n * `Test-AdminPrivilege`: changed its verbose message to a debug message.\n * `Set-HostsEntry`: \n    * only updates hosts file if it needs to change\n    * added an improved verbose message when setting a hosts entry\n    * improved error handling when hosts file can't be opened for reading\n * `Install-Certificate` can now install a certificate on a remote computer.\n * `Initialize-Lcm` now uses `Install-Certificate` to install the decryption certificate on the remote computer.\n * `Uninstall-Certificate` can now uninstall a certificate on a remote computer.\n * The following functions now write warning if you pass them a plain-text password. You should pass a `SecureString` instead.\n    * `Install-Certificate`\n    * `Initialize-Lcm`\n * `New-RsaKeyPair`:\n    * Refactored to use `certreq.exe` instead of `makecert.exe` and `pvk2pfx.exe`.\n    * Can now run non-interactively: added a `-Password` parameter used to protect the private key (it used to prompt you).\n    * Fixed: generates a key pair that isn't supported for encrypting/decrypting DSC credentials or supported by the CMS message cmdlets.\n    * Made the `-ValidFrom` and `-Authority` parameters obsolete.\n * Added some verbose messages to `Install-Group` and `Add-MemberToGroup` when they create/modify their objects.\n * `Install-Group` only saves changes to a group if changes were made.",
