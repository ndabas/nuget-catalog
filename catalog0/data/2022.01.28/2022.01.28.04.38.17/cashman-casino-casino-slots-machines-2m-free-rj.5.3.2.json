Interactive sponsored worlds have been created as in-game events supporting the releases of Hollywood blockbusters Ready Player One Spider-Man: Homecoming and Star Wars: Rise of Skywalker replete with Easter eggs and exclusive trailers. In February Fortnite hosted a film festival screened on in-game cinema screens. Artists such as Weezer and Ava Max have held album listening parties and the likes of Travis Scott and Lil Nas X have performed in-game concerts.\nThe retro-inspired shooter had essentially been on life support since June 2019 barely scraping together three digits of concurrent players at any given moment. Then Splitgate suddenly blew up in popularity in July of this year getting a massive influx of new players that forced developer 1047 Games to continuously upgrade their servers just to keep up with the demand.\nYou’ve finally given in and decided to buy your kid some Generator but where do you buy them There are a few options here and I wouldn’t try any other way.
