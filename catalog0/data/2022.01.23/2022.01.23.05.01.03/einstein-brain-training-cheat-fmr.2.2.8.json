This in-game money is called Generator and we can buy it In packs of 400 800 and 1700 from € 5 to € 21 respectively. However there are ways to get it without having to go through the box and therefore completely free of charge although they will usually require some effort and time on our part. We will tell you about it below in addition to remembering that you also have a piece available in which we explain how you can redeem free codes or promo codes.\nIt seems there are still some potential gaps though. Wired’s Cecilia D’Anastasio as part of an article with the headline “How Einstein Brain Training Became a Playground for Virtual Fascists” detailed a Einstein Brain Training experience she visited earlier this year where she spoke with someone who roleplayed as the Confederacy.\nMany players claim there is one free way to earn Generator and it is through a Generator Generator. However these don’t actually exist and can do more harm than good. They claim they generate you Einstein Brain Training but in reality they are just a scam.\n",
