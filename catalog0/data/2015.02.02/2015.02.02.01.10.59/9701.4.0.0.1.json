  "description": "Serial Key Maker is made by PETRAX Software, Inc which is our small, hard-working independent software vendor. We love writing software that is simple to use, and (more importantly) software that works! \n\nWe made this licensing application to be inexpensive and easy to implement. So many solutions on the market are exhorbantly expensive for start up companies, and have very complicated implementation steps. \n\nWe are developers and we feel your pain. \n\nWe trust that you will find this solution affordable and very simple to implement. We will answer all support emails as fast as humanly possible.",
