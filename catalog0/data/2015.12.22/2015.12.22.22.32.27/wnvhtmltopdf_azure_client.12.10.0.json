  "description": "Winnovative HTML to PDF Converter for Azure can be used in Azure Websites which have to run under a restricted environment. The general library for .NET can still be used directly in web roles and worker roles of Azure Cloud Services and in applications running on Azure Virtual Machines but it cannot be used in Azure Websites directly because of the restrictions imposed by this type of applications.\n\nWhile the Winnovative HTML to PDF Converter Library for .NET does not depend on any external services or programs, the solution for Azure Websites requires the installation of a HTML to PDF server which was built on the library for .NET. \n\nIn order to use the Winnovative HTML to PDF Converter for Azure you first have to publish the HTML to PDF Server in Azure. The client library for .NET that you reference in your application will know how to connect to the HTML to PDF Server to convert HTML to PDF, to Image or to SVG.\n\nThe converter offers full support for HTML tags, HTML5 with CSS3, SVG and Web Fonts, page breaks control, media type rules, repeating HTML table header and footer, hierarchical bookmarks, tables of contents, fillable PDF forms, HTML with page numbering in header and footer.",
