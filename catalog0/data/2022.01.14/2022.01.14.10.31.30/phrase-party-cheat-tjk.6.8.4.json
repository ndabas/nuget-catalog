While playing the game other players in the game ask them to visit a url to get some free Phrase Party Free Coins Free Gold Free Gems Free Diamonds Generator no human verification. This website is blox.surf and apparently it will reward them with Phrase Party Free Coins Free Gold Free Gems Free Diamonds Generator no human verification as per the message.

As you can see there are vehicles for all levels of players in Brookhaven from those who wish to play for free or save their Generator and those who don’t mind spend some money to get what they want.\n",
