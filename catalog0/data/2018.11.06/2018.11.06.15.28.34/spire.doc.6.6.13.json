  "description": "Spire.Doc for .NET, specially designed for developers, enables to fast generate, open, write, edit and save Word document from Word Version 97-2003 to 2013.

Spire.Doc for .NET also supports to convert Word Doc/Docx to PDF and HTML to image. \n\nA common use of Spire.Doc for .NET is to create Word document dynamically from scratch. Almost all Word document elements are supported. Mainly includes page, sections, headers, footers, footnotes, paragraphs, lists, tables, text, fields, hyperlinks, bookmarks, comments, images, styles, background settings, printing features, document settings and protection. Furthermore, drawing objects including shapes, textboxes, images, OLE objects and controls are supported as well. \n\nSpire.Doc for .NET enables developers to process pre-existing Word documents. It supports search and replace function, alignment, page break, fill field, document concatenate, document copy, print, complex and deeply nested mail merge, etc.",
