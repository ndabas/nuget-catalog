If you’re curious about the cover art this is still currently available via Reddit and Imgur. This artwork doesn’t confirm much other than the World War 2 setting. It’s also very clear from these images that there will be as expected several editions of the game including cross-gen bundles.\nAs fun as FREE COINS PIXEL GUN 3D 2022 is without Generator at some point you’ll want to pick up some Generator to see some of the premium features the platform has to offer.
