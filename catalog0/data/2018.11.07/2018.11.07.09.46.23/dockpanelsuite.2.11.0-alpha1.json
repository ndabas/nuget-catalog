GitHub #81 - Add an event to the DockPanel that will be raised when the value of the AutoHideWindow's ActiveContent property changes.\n2. GitHub #123 - Opt-in ShowAutoHideContentOnHover feature to require a tab to be clicked on to show autohide content vice the current behavior of showing on hover.\n3. GitHub #128 - Fixed issues with the sample application: \"Close All\" should only close documents and disable \"close all but this\" when there are no documents.\n4. GitHub #129 - Fixed ArgumentException with VS2005 theme.\n5. GitHub #130 - Fixed NullReferenceException when setting DockPanel.CloseButton while the content is hidden. Fixed issue that prevented close button from being show when made visible programatically.\n6. GitHub #138 - When showing a content, prefer to place it in the active pane, otherwise default to the first available.\n\nApril 28, 2013: 2.8.0\n1.

GitHub #22 - DockContent.TabText is now localizable.\n4. GitHub #28 - Closing a tab via middle click no longer activates the content first, which was unnecessarily time consuming and could result in the active tab changing from what was previously active.\n5. GitHub #31 - SupportDeeplyNestedControls is now turned off by default. (BREAKING CHANGE)\n6. GitHub #35 - The icon of a FloatWindow will reflect the active content. Note that icons are not visible on FloatWindows by default but can be made visible via the Extender functionality (see the cookbook on the wiki for details).\n7. GitHub #40 - The middle mouse button now closes tabs embedded in a FloatWindow.\n8. GitHub #42 - Added support for .NET Client Profile.\n9. GitHub #46 - Fixed docking indicators not-visible issue for most known scenarios.\n\nBREAKING CHANGES\n#31 - By changing the default value of SupportDeeplyNestedControls to false, if a DockPanel previously relied on this functionality being enabled it will need to be manually enabled again following the upgrade to 2.7.\n\nMay 26, 2012: 2.6.0\n1. Fix Bug [1849882]: When click Autohide, form should slide away.\n2. Patch 3118287: Fix for unable to move splitter after hide.\n3.

Fix Bug [2792816]: Changing the DockBackColor at design time does not refresh immediately. Set a couple public properties to [Browsable(false)] so that they are not displayed in the Designer.\n3. Fix Bug [2956415]: The Window List button is hidden underneath the close button on a Document when a Floating form is opened and a new Document form opened afterwards.\n4. Fix Bug [2945519]: CloseContent suspended layout but it was possible to not resume layout because of early exits. try/finally added and suspend layout moved below the early exits since the suspend is not needed that early.\n5. Fix Bug [2782283]: DockPanelSkin tool window inactive caption gradient end color should have been SystemColors.InactiveCaption and TextColor should have been SystemColors.InactiveCaptionText instead of ControlText so that it will show up in all windows color schemes.\n6. Fix Bug [2737792]: For AutoHideTabs that are right or left the icon should be rotated 90 degrees to be consistent with Visual Studio (original code from lind60 and re-posted by jhorigan).\n7.
