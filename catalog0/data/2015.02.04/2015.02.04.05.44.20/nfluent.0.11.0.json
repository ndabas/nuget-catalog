  "description": "NFluent is an ergonomic check library which aims to fluent your .NET TDD experience (based on simple Check.That() check statements). NFluent aims your tests to be fluent to write (with an happy 'dot' auto completion experience), fluent to read (i.e. as close as possible to plain English expression), but also fluent to troubleshoot, in a less-error-prone way comparing to the classical .NET test frameworks. NFluent is directly, but also freely, inspired by the awesome Java FEST fluent check/reflection library (http://fest.easytesting.org/).",

ExtensibilityHelper)\n\n* Adds IsNull() and IsNotNull() checks.\n\n* Enhances the Lambda check experience by supporting checks on Func, allowing writing of some usual tests without braces, and giving the possibility to check message and properties of Exceptions\n\n--------------\n\nChange(s):\n\n* Now, Check.That(4L).IsEqualTo(4) passes instead of throwing that types are differents.\n\n--------------\n\nBug Fixe(s):",
