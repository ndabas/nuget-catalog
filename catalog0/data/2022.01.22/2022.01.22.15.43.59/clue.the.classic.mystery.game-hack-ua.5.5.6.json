It’s free to download though buying Generator costs real money.\nGetting your account hijacked by hackers is yet another downside that prevents most people from using Clue The Classic Mystery Game generators.\nIt seems there are still some potential gaps though. Wired’s Cecilia D’Anastasio as part of an article with the headline “How Clue The Classic Mystery Game Became a Playground for Virtual Fascists” detailed a Clue The Classic Mystery Game experience she visited earlier this year where she spoke with someone who roleplayed as the Confederacy.\nAlternatively you can always buy Gems with your hard-earned Generator instead. The table below breaks down the number of Gems you can buy and how much they’ll cost you in Generator.\nClue The Classic Mystery Game Corp. recently went public as well which raised the company’s market cap to $38 billion. The company went public via a direct listing instead of an initial public offering and the company’s stocks were trading over 40% higher than the price during the private financing round. As the game continues to grow the developers have a number of things planned for the game including a display name change update and a voice chat feature.\n",
