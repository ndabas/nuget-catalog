  "description": "This page contains all the GTA 5 cheats for Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One and Xbox 360 as well as information about using them. We've tested each code ourselves, dozens of times, so you know they'll work. Read the following guide and you'll be spawning vehicles, unlocking all the weapons and running around Los Santos invincible before you know it!\n\nCLICK HERE NOW>> https://gamesapp.pro/gta5\n\nCLICK HERE NOW>> https://gamesapp.pro/gta5\n\nThis GTA 5 Cheats and Secrets guide contains a complete list of all cheats for PS5, PS4, PS3, Xbox Series X, Xbox One, Xbox 360, and PC versions of Grand Theft Auto 5 (also known as Grand Theft Auto V). Cheats are a fun way to play because you don't have to worry about getting items the usual way. Instead of exploring the map in search of a vehicle or weapon, you can enter a cheat code and jump straight into the action.\n\nThe only cheat you won't find here is an \"infinite money cheat\" because money is something you have to get on your own in GTA 5. We suggest checking out our guide on how to make money in GTA 5 if you're looking for money-making tips.",
