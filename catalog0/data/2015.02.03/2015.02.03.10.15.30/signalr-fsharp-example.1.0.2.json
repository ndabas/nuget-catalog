  "description": "Example of SignalR 1.1.1 with F-Sharp (and Silverlight 5 or Javascript):\n\n- SignalR is a library (for web-based Publish/Subscribe -pattern) on top \n  of WebSockets, which is HTML5 API that enables bi-directional communication \n  between the browser and server. SignalR will fallback to other techniques and \n  technologies when WebSockets are not available.\n  http://signalr.net/\n  \n- F-Sharp (F#) is multiparadigm (functional-first) programming language \n  mainly for .NET environment.\n  http://fsharp.org/\n  \n- This sample uses Reactive Extensions 2.1 to communicate with SignalR, \n  on both client and server side. Reactive Extensions is a library to \n  compose asynchronous and event-based programs using observable \n  collections and LINQ-style query operators.\n  http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/data/gg577609.aspx\n\n- For server side:  \n  This could work purely from F# as Owin (http://owin.org/) console application \n  but now Owin-code is in comments and F#-server-side is called from an\n  empty ASP.NET C# Web Application. (Still you can start OWin from F# Interactive...)\n\n- For client side:\n  Silverlight 5.0 application using F#-library\n  and Silverlight 5.0 XAML/C# application to show the user interface.\n  http://www.silverlight.net\n  There is also jQuery/JavaScript test page, if you don't want to use Silverlight.\n  \n- This proof of concept/sample/tutorial/demo is developed with \n  Visual Studio 2012. References are resolved via NuGet. \n  F# compiler won't auto-restore packages on compile. \n  So go first to Tools -> Library Package Manager -> NuGet\n  and press \"Restore\" to restore all the references, and then rebuild.\n\n- SignalR supports two kinds of connections: Hub and PersistentConnection\n  Both are working with Silverlight and JavaScript.",
