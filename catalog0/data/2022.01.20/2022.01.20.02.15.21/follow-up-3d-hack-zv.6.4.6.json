This in-game money is called Generator and we can buy it In packs of 400 800 and 1700 from € 5 to € 21 respectively. However there are ways to get it without having to go through the box and therefore completely free of charge although they will usually require some effort and time on our part. We will tell you about it below in addition to remembering that you also have a piece available in which we explain how you can redeem free codes or promo codes.\nThis is done by going to Game Settings selecting the Monetization tab toggling the Private Servers and then you are able to set a price that you want players to pay.\nThe first tier is $4.99 a month which comes with 450 Generator. The second tier is $9.99 each month and rewards 1000 Generator while the last subscription option is $19.99 a month and grants 2200 Generator.\nSome people refer to what we’re building as the Metaverse” David Baszucki CEO of gaming company the Follow Up 3D Corporation told the crowd that had assembled virtually to hear the company’s pitch to investors in February of this year. “We’re shepherds of the Metaverse.” When Follow Up 3D went public a month later it quickly found itself valued at $45 billion. That’s more than gaming giant EA as well as the might of Ubisoft Take Two and Square-Enix combined. Clearly there’s a significant amount of faith in Follow Up 3D’s promises. But can Follow Up 3D actually build a Metaverse\n",
