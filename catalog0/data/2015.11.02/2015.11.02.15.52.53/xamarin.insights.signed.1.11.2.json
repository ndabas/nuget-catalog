  "releaseNotes": "# Insights client, 1.11.2\n\nPoint release for the 1.11 series, includes a newer plCrashReporter that fixes some ios9 issues, bugs and performance issues fixed\n\n# Insights client release, 1.11.0 \n\nThis release is mostly maintenance but has a few API changes of note and thus is a minor release. \n\n## Changes \n\n* The following API can now be set before Insights.Initialize is called \n  * `Insights.DisableCollection` \n  * `Insights.DisableDataTransmission` \n  * `Insights.DisableExceptionCatching` \n  * `Insights.ForceDataTransmission` \n* Additional traits can now be assigned to a previously Identified user by passing null as the first argument to `Insights.Identify` \n* There is an additional optional named argument in Insights.Initialize(), setting blockOnStartupCrashes to true will cause insights to block your main initialisation on startup in order to submit any startup crashes to Insights. This may be useful for those that are not concerned with startup time, please note that the delay could be substantial and it is not default for this reason \n\nThere are many assorted bug fixes and maintenance fixes in this release",
