These were “simulated physics laboratories” which allowed users to design environments they could experiment within – by constructing destructible houses for instance or crashing two cars together at various speeds or maybe by taking the tools in altogether weirder and more unexpected directions.\nPlayers can only make this trade once per day and hence it is a tedious method of collecting gems.
