  "description": "MVVM, bare knuckle style!\n      Blue.MVVM is, and will remain, an ultra lightweight suite supporting your Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) based applications.\n\n\n      _about this package_\n\n      This package includes binaries only. You should use this package for test projects or assemblies that need to interact with types in Blue.MVVM.\n      For a head start, use Blue.MVVM (http://www.nuget.org/packages/Blue.MVVM/) instead.\n\n\n      _what to expect in future releases?_\n\n      There are many ideas around regarding upcoming releases of the Blue.MVVM suite.\n      However, those updates will be shipped in form of additional packages. This way, you can add just those packages that best fits your application and needs.\n\n      Upcoming releases may include, but are not limited to:\n      + XML-comments\n      - packages with samples\n      - (fluid)validation\n      - message broker\n      - IoC-Container integration\n      - public git-repo\n      - many more...\n\n      So stay tuned for updates!\n\n\n      Send feedback, feature-request, unexpected breaking changes, etc. via the projects nuget-page, http://www.nuget.org/packages/Blue.MVVM.Lib/ContactOwners, until there is a projet homepage...",
