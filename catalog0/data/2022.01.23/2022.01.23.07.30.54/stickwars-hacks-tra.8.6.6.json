StickWars has come up as a contentious topic in the Epic Games v. Apple trial as well.\nWhen you first make your StickWars account you might get carried away and enter a username that won’t stand the test of time. However sometimes you’re just not thinking about it and come up with a much better username down the line. This guide will cover how you can change your StickWars username and cover if you can do this for free.\nYou shouldn’t hop into StickWars expecting to play games with the production values of something like Final Fantasy VII Remake or even Fall Guys. Many of the StickWars games I’ve tried feel somewhat rudimentary offering simple controls and graphics. But the point isn’t really to go pro in any one StickWars game — it’s more that there are millions of virtual spaces to hang out and many of them have the added benefit of being games.\nThe prices for the items are all over the map and it is up to you to research similar designs to learn what they are going for in the catalog. It is a great way to make some extra Generator if this sounds like something you might be interested in doing.\n",
