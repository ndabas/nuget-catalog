  "releaseNotes": "This version of Rabbit contains breaking changes. These changes are as follows:\n\n- The LogIn function is now called \"LogOn\".\n- The AuthType parameter has been removed.\n- The CreateRoom parameter is now a field that must be specified before the connection takes place if you wish not to create a room.\n- The LogOn function is overloaded and so the password field can be omitted if using Facebook authentication.\n- The LogOn function method is now non-static. The new syntax is as follows:\n var conn = new RabbitAuth().LogOn(EmailOrTokenOrUserName, RoomID, Password);\n- PlayerIO 3.0.10 is now required in order for Rabbit to function. The new PlayerIO client can be downloaded at Yahoo Games Network\nBug fixes:\n\n- Fixed issue where authenticating with a user id would throw a NullReferenceException and halt authentication (and in some cases with a username).\n- MouseBreaker authentication is now supported. Security issues arising with authenticating with Armor Games first has been fixed (the tokens can be easily distinguished and this check has been disabled).\n- Small issue where the error message may contain a sentence that begins with a lowercase letter (grammatically incorrect).",
