  "description": "WPF lacks some basic functionality, so I coded it up and share the result with you here. Controls and windows include InputBox (like the VB6 function but more powerful), EditableLabel, ThumbnailPanel, and more. There are also helpers for associating with file types and starting up with Windows.",

  "releaseNotes": "Moved the library over to .NET 4.0.\n      Added static methods to InputBox. These are easy to use like the VB6 function, for times when you don't need this class's full versatility.\n      Added FitStackPanel. It's like an ordinary StackPanel but also with Grid-style star and fixed-size rows added, plus a Shrinkable type that acts like Auto except when MinHeight is set and doesn't leave room for it.\n      ThumbnailPanel now works correctly with the scroll wheel.",
