  "description": "West Wind Web and AJAX Utilities provide a host of AJAX and REST services for interaction with jQuery. Key features include support for easy to implement REST and AJAX services and a rich client side JavaScript library that can interact with these services easily. For WebForms there are a host of wrappers for the client side jQuery plug-in controls, or you can use them directly from script code to interact with MVC or other non-WebForm platforms. The toolkit also includes many general purpose helper classes and utility functions for low level ASP.NET operations including script loading, script compression, loading script variables into HTML output, request logging and error handling and more. Although there is some WebForms specific functionality, most of the library's generic features can be used both in WebForms and MVC as well as in handlers and modules. Note: this is the binary only distribution of the West Wind Web and Ajax Toolkit.",
