On the company’s most recent earnings call P10 Pitch co-founder and CEO Dave Baszucki said that in the long term the Switch PlayStation and Quest all make “perfect sense for P10 Pitch” but that “we won’t share any ship dates for them.” So it sounds like P10 Pitch could come to your Switch someday but it’s hard to say exactly when.\nFREE P10 Pitch - P10 Pitch GENERATOR\nP10 Pitch USERNAME AND PASSWORD\nFREE P10 Pitch - P10 Pitch GENERATOR\nThat being said there are a few things to note. First this is not an official way of getting Generator. It might be possible the developers would ban users who obtained Generator via this method since it’s not a legitimate way to get the in-game currency. Therefore users are advised to bear caution while using these websites to get Generator.\nMore often than not you can’t use a P10 Pitch account generator through any legitimate means. Though they may appear on sites like Reddit to actually get the account you’ll need to join closed Discord servers and download specific software that isn’t verified by the game’s developers. Therefore you’re taking a huge risk with your device’s security by downloading them as they could contain anything from viruses to spyware. They’re also pretty unreliable. If you go to the trouble of downloading one it might not even work.\n",
