In other words there’s no limit to the number of free Gems you can get.\nFinally the left-hand side of the page (on PC) should allow players to visit their inventory. Through this tab players should be able to see all the new items they’ve received from their promo codes under the appropriate inventory category tabs.\nMr. Rich will drop a Cyclops Eyeball once defeated. Pick the Cyclops Eyeball and head over to meet Oz the Wizard. Here you can trade the Cyclops Eyeball with Oz for 20 gems.\nThe digital money is then transferred directly into your PayPal account. From here your cash earnings can be used to acquire Generator – at no extra cost.\nCreating a game in the HOUSE OF FUN FREE PROMO CODES engine might seem easy but it's actually incredibly difficult to get everything to work 100% correctly.
