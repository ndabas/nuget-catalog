  "releaseNotes": "v3.0.0:\n      - Added an analyzer that forces immutable structs to have readonly modifier\n      - Struct equatability analyzer has been changed to ignore structs that don't have a readonly modifier\n      - Fields of non-readonly structs are no longer enforced to be readonly\n      - Struct equatability diagnostics have new shared ID that allows suppressing them all with a single #pragma\n      - Extended ConfigureAwait() analyzer to support arbitrary awaitable types\n\n      v2.0.0:\n      - Migrated to Roslyn 2.0\n      - Updated analyzers and code fixes to respect C# 7.1\n\n      v1.7.1:\n      - fixed an exception caused by the Roslyn type resolve bug\n\n      v1.7.0:\n      - an analyzer that detects struct null comparison\n\n      v1.6.0:\n      - an analyzer that detects unused method parameters\n\n      v1.5.1:\n      - equality and mutability warnings are no longer reported for the struct enumerators\n      - internal members are no longer considered unused if assembly has [InternalsVisibleTo] attribute\n      - private members referenced from other partial class definitions are no longer considered unused\n      - all analyzers use default heuristics to skip generated files\n\n      v1.5.0:\n      - an analyzer that detects unused class members (private and internal only)\n\n      v1.4.5:\n      - disabled formatting analyzer until it can be re-implemented properly\n\n      v1.4.4:\n      - suppressed another format of auto-generated comments\n\n      v1.4.3:\n      - changed diagnsotic IDs to provide compatibility with VS 2015 update 1\n\n      v1.4.2:\n      - an attempt to fix the FormattingAnalyzer warning issued on VS loading it from a nuget package\n\n      v1.4.1:\n      - merged in the analyzer that enforces ConfigureAwait()\n      - fixed a bunch of bugs\n\n      v1.4.0:\n      - an analyzer that enforces explicit access modifiers\n      - an analyzer that enforces immutability and equatability on structs\n      - all analyzers ignore auto-generated code\n\n      v1.3.0:\n      - an analyzer that enforces the proper code formatting\n      - a refactoring to convert one-line properties to expression-bodied properties\n\n      v1.2.1:\n      - fixed Nuget package installation issues\n      - readonly modifier can now be enforced on fields of primitive types\n      - var can be converted to explicit type inside the using declaration block\n      - var can no longer be converted if it's generic type with anonymous arguments\n      - conversion to expression-bodied member is no longer suggested for the methods that can't be converted\n      - the reference is no longer considered unused if a method that returns a type declared in it is invoked\n\n      v1.2.0:\n      - a refactoring to convert String.Format() call to an interpolated string\n      - a refactoring to convert var to explicit type name and back\n\n      v1.1.0:\n      - unused project references are reported to the error/information list\n\n      v1.0.2:\n      - upgraded to VS 2015 RTM\n\n      v1.0.1:\n      - readonly modifier is no longer enforced on value type fields (to avoid SpinLock-like issues)\n\n      v1.0.0:\n      - enforce readonly modifier on fields\n      - convert one-line methods to expression-bodied methods",
