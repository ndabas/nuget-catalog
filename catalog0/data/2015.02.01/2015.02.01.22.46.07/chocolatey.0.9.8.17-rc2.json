  "description": "Chocolatey - think executables/application packages (like apt-get for Windows), not library packages. This is what the Chocolatey NuGet goodness is for.\nChocolatey allows you to install application nuggets and run executables from anywhere.  \n======= Executable Nuggets =======\nFor example, say you have an executable in the tools folder of your package named bob.exe. Then you can type\n'chocolatey install yourPackageName [-source source] [-version version]' OR 'cinst yourPackageName [-source source] [-version version]'\nand when it finishes you can type\n'bob'\nand it will run your application executable.  \n======= Application Nuggets =======\nFull on double rainbow. For example, say you type \n'chocolatey install 7zip [-source source] [-version version]' OR 'cinst 7zip [-source source] [-version version]' \n- when it finishes you will have installed 7zip on your machine (in your add/remove programs).  \n======= More? =======\nCheck out the WIKI in the project URL for all the details of what you can do with chocolatey!",
