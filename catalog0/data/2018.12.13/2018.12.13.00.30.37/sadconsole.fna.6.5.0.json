  "releaseNotes": "## 6.5.0\n- Fix a stack overflow problem in the window object introduced by the previous mouse bug fix.\n- Cell states can be stored and restored with variables now. Each cell still has a backing cellstate that can be used.\n- NoDrawSurface.FromSurface is now static. (as it should have been)\n## 6.4.11\n- Fixed bug in mouse processing (thanks VGA256)\n## 6.4.10\n- Fixed WindowResized event to actually be event!\n## 6.4.9\n- Added WindowResized event to the Game class.\n- Added some new color extension methods (clear channel, alpha only).\n## 6.4.8\n- Added Settings.WindowMinimumSize.\n## 6.4.7\n- Fixed keyboard problem with selection button.\n- Font class now has a link back to the FontMaster instance.\n- Added SadConsole.Settings.GraphicsProfile for monogame hidef vs reach.\n- Added a Mouse.Clear to clear state (like keyboard has)\n- Game has a OnDestroy callback now for when the game starts to shut down.\n- VirtualCursor bugs fixed. Also supports print effects again.\n- DrawString instruction uses a VirtualCursor all the time (.Cursor property) to fix issues with printing. (thanks vga256)\n- VirtualCursor uses the solid square character as default now instead of underscore.\n- FontMaster caches Font objects created with GetFont. The same instance is passed around now instead of a new one.\n- Fade effect has UseCellDestinationReverse to reverse the logic of the of using the back/fore cell color.\n## 6.4.6\n- Fixed logic for TabStop with ControlsConsole. It was stopping a focused control from being tabbed off of, not stopping a control from being tabbed to.\n- Keyboard input was reversing '[' with '{' and ']' with '}'\n- Controls now refresh when you change the theme with Control.Theme = variable.\n## 6.4.5\n- Added SadConsole.GameHelpers.Directions class and helpers.\n- SurfaceEditor now supports basic shape functions. Easier to draw shapes than previous model. (Line only supported for now, more to come)\n- Lines can be auto connected through static SurfaceEditor.ConnectLines method.\n- Promoted a bunch of private members for the Window class to protected.\n- Window title row can be positioned by the class now. Use the protected titleLocationY variable.\n- ListBox.HideBorder instantly redraws instead of waiting for a `IsDirty` flag.\n## 6.4.4\n- Added new Palette and Timer classes.\n- Added extension method to ColorGradient that returns a Color[] based on the stops.\n- Fixed a bug in InputBox that happened when you clicked twice on the control. Thanks arxae and naknode!\n- Fixed effect manager remove methods.\n- Fixed mouse processing other consoles after it was found over the top-most\n- Created a LayeredSurface.Load single param overload to block accidentally calling BasicSurface.Load\n- MouseHandler for a Console has changed. If it assigned, the normal mouse processing logic will no longer run.\n- Fixed rendering problem with consoles created after initialization. (thanks kingvitamin103)",
