  "description": "Sometimes a human just has to do additional work or ad hoc work on data within a C# application. Seashell provides a robust framework to get data into Excel where we humans can work with it. It's a great tool for analytics groups and cases where auditors or management need to understand the intermediate steps of calculations in your code. \n\n1) It's optimized so you don't have to worry about the underlying COM application.\n2) It separates the concerns of marshalling data and displaying that data, enhancing your code's flexibility.\n3) It allows you to build structured and formatted Excel workbooks so that your users can focus on the work that they want to do in Excel, not boilerplate work.",
