So taking advantage of the free codes is an excellent method to add some variety to the in-game wardrobe. But remember that promo codes may expire or only be active for a short period of time so make sure to use the codes right away.\nRichard Bartle – a senior lecturer in computer game design at the University of Essex where in 1978 he created the Multi-User Dungeon a text-based game credited with being the first-ever virtual world – is unconvinced that experiencing media and meeting other avatars inside game worlds can be interpreted as the inception of a Metaverse. “Yes you can [do those things]. But why would you” he says matter-of-factly. “In pandemic times it's easy to say that: ‘You can go online and watch movies with your mates!’ But why would I need to go online when I can just watch it on my television which is much bigger – and doesn't have little [avatars] anywhere”\n",
