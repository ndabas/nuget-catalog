  "releaseNotes": "Finally, a way to query a Microsoft SQL Server Analysis Database with LINQ and type safe objects! \n\nBeta version - Comes without any warranties.  \nPlease contact me via the \"Contact Owners\" link for any questions, comments, bugs, or features you think should be included. Make sure to read the \"Documentation\" text file that is included with the package. \nANY feedback is GREATLY appreciated, as this is still a work in progress.\n\nChanges: \n-Added a type of implementation to include a sub cube using PAS syntax.\n\n-Fixed a further issue with sub cubes and PAS syntax that prevented it from querying.\n\n-Update the documentation file.  It was horribly out of date.\n\n-Added ability to add and remove objects in a PAS query more easily.\n\n-Added functionality in the translator to automatically add the member group extension on an attribute, i.e.  cube.Sales.StoreID will now translate to [Sales].[Store ID].[Store ID].\n\n-Fixed a bug with creating query scoped calculated members or sets in a cube's partial class, throwing the exception saying something similar to \"Calculated members or set must use the WithSet attribute or WithMember attribute\", or \"Must result in a constant\".\n\nComing Changes:\n**NOTE -> Upcoming changes include removing the \"WithSet\" and \"WithMember\" attributes. Creating a query scoped calculated member or set is accomplished in a cube's partial class you created.  More notes on this will be included in the next update.\n\n-Changing the generator to only generate each dimension once, and sharing them among their respective cube classes.\n\nDown The Road Changes:\n-Hefty refactor of the way LINQ queries are written to incorporate querying more than 2 axis, and including specifying what members and sets are placed on what axis.
