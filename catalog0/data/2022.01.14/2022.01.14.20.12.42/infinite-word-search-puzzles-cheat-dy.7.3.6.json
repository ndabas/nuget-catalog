Games that offer special upgrades premium services completely unique items and include advertisements tend to make a ton of money.\nIt's a good way to spark creativity and make a little bit of spending currency on the side too. If you make a particularly popular design the Generator will start to flow in before you know it.\nIn the box that says ‘Enter Your Code’ players should input the code they are trying to redeem. If entering the code is followed by a green thumbs-up the redemption was successful and the items should be in the player's inventory. If entering the code is followed by a red thumbs-down icon the code is invalid meaning it is likely expired or has already been redeemed.\nTix also known as Tickets was a currency that was present almost since its launch. Tix didn’t cost money and players could earn by it logging in daily visiting their Place and a number of other ways. Tix could also be converted into Generator which is something players used to do a lot. Considering that it was just a free way to earn Generator people started creating alternate accounts to get more Generator and it almost entirely killed the point of Generator.\n",
