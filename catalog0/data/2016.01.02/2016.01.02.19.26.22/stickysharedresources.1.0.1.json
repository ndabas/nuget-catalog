  "description": "Sticky Shared Resources is designed to help you manage shared memory between multiple threads. It allows you to:\n* Create resources associated to C# objects\n* Acquire these resources in much the same way you might \"acquire\" a semaphore.\n* Connect resources together. If you acquire a resource, this package ensures you will also acquire all resources it is connected to.\n* Disconnect resources so threads can pick them up independently again.\nThis package helps you to manipulate these resources in parallel through \"resource groups\". You create a resource group and ask it to be populated with all the resources you need. You then manipulate these resources and, once you're done, you free the resource group, which frees the resources for other threads.\nDo not create multiple resource groups in the same thread! For the least painful experience, stick to one concurrency control mechanism (monitors / semaphores / resource groups). If you've got that, you're set! \n\nThis package is a stepping stone for a more friendly way to manage shared memory between threads - through pipes.",
