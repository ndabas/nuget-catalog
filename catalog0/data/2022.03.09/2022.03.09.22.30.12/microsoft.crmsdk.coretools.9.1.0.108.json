Trace Listener collection would not be released within a process over a very long time frame over multiple connections. This would manifest as increasing memory consumption over a very long period. \n    Fix cleans this up on the .dispose() call on the CrmServiceClient. \n    Note: if you have built your own logger based on the Microsoft.Xrm.Tooling.Connector.TraceLoggerBase, you must call .dispose() when you are done with it to clean up the listener collection assigned to it.\n\n8.2.0.4:\n    Fixes:\n    Addressed an issue with customers who use optionset type generators and or linq class access that do not have a handler to define type enum’s for optionsets.  This update will provide support for older behaviors in addition to supporting developer who use enum based optionset generators \n\n8.2.0.3: \n    CrmSvcUtil.exe : \n        Updated to correct version of crmsvcutil for the current version of CRM that exposes all command line switches\n    SolutionPackager.exe: \n        Fixes in dependency mapper and that caused issues with some solutions\n8.2.0.2: Fix of dependency issue in nuget package. Now properly requires .net 4.5.2 as a baseline\n8.2.0.1 Refreshed from current release\n    Fixed site map packing issue in solutionpackager.exe\n8.2.0: Removed Deprecated Assemblies and Executables. Updated to current bits.\n8.1.0.1: Updated the Microsoft.IdentityModel.Clients.ActiveDirectory assemblies as required by the Xrm Tooling assemblies.\n8.1.0: CRM Online 2016 Update 1\n8.1-preview: Pre-release CRM Online 2016 Update 1\n8.0.2.1: UR1 (Update Rollup 1) with customer related hotfix\n8.0.2: UR1 (Update Rollup 1)\n8.0.1: GA (General Availability)\n8.0.0: RTM release\n\n\n* The CrmSvcUtil.exe program has been updated with additional command line parameters.
