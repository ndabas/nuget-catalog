  "description": "> **Warning**\n>\n> This is a pre-release version of Chocolatey CLI and it is **NOT** suitable for production use! A pre-release version will have bugs that could have a detrimental impact to your environment. Ensure all necessary due diligence steps are taken before using in your environment.\n\n> **Warning**\n>\n> This pre-release version of Chocolatey CLI does **NOT** work with the Chocolatey Licensed Extension. It will actually prevent the loading of the Chocolatey Licensed Extension if it is installed.\n\n> **Note**\n>\n> If you run into any problems when using this alpha version of Chocolatey CLI we would ask that you comment on this [discussion](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/discussions/2995), which is where we will be collating issues, and providing workarounds, etc.  We will not be accepting issues raised against this alpha release.\n\n### Known Issues\n\nSee this [list](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/discussions/2995) for known issues with this pre-release.\n\nChocolatey is a package manager for Windows (like apt-get but for Windows). It was designed to be a decentralized framework for quickly installing applications and tools that you need. It is built on the NuGet infrastructure currently using PowerShell as its focus for delivering packages from the distros to your door, err computer.\n\nChocolatey is brought to you by the work and inspiration of the community, the work and thankless nights of the Chocolatey Team (https://github.com/orgs/chocolatey/people), with Rob heading up the direction.\n\nYou can host your own sources and add them to Chocolatey, you can extend Chocolatey's capabilities, and folks, it's only going to get better.\n\nThis is the Chocolatey Library (API / DLL) package which allows Chocolatey to be embedded in your application.\n\n### Information\n\n- [Chocolatey Website and Community Package Repository](https://community.chocolatey.org)\n- [Mailing List](http://groups.google.com/group/chocolatey) / [Release Announcements Only Mailing List](https://groups.google.com/group/chocolatey-announce) / [Build Status Mailing List](http://groups.google.com/group/chocolatey-build-status)\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/chocolateynuget) / [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ChocolateySoftware) / [GitHub](https://github.com/chocolatey)\n- [Blog](https://blog.chocolatey.org/) / [Newsletter](https://chocolatey.us8.list-manage1.com/subscribe?u=86a6d80146a0da7f2223712e4&id=73b018498d)\n- [Documentation](https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/) / [Support](https://chocolatey.org/support)",
