It takes some effort but it's a great option for players wanting a little more premium currency.\nAlternatively you can redeem your Family Style Co-op Kitchen gift card when checking out from the Family Style Co-op Kitchen shop.\nThe first step to earning a lot of Generator is to build your own game within Family Style Co-op Kitchen that other players can enjoy. Once your game has a following then Family Style Co-op Kitchen will use a metric to see how many premium players often play this game and then you will be rewarded with a stipend.\nThe recent update in Family Style Co-op Kitchen Wacky Wizards introduced gems as a new currency. Similar to Generator gems can be used for purchasing premium ingredients and cauldron skins in the game. Apart from purchasing gems with real money players can also use a free alternative to acquire gems.\n",
