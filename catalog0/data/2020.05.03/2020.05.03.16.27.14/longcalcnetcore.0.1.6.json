  "releaseNotes": "Corrected a terrible inefficiency in the division routines in the previous version which was most apparent when the divisor was very large in magnitude or very close to zero.\n\nRe-worked the various routines that initialized objects from strings or files and those that output objects to strings or files. This was done because several problems or potential problems were discovered in those routines.\nIt should be noted that, with this version, when attempting to initialize a Matrix object from string or file, if there are insufficient data elements (less than RowLength x ColumnLength items), the initialization will not error-out but instead initialize the missing entries to zero.\n\nCorrected a glaring inaccuracy in some of the Zeta calculations for inputs less than .5 in value.\n\nChecks for arithmetic overflow or underflow are again compiler-included in this release.",

  "summary": "This library, built with and accessible by Visual Studio (2019) and using Net Core's BigInteger for the underlying integer math, supplies a variety of math functions and utilities with precisions as large as 2,000,000 base 10 digits. The underlying objects are bf (for 'big float') real values comprised of a BigInteger mantissa and base 2 exponent, bcr (for complex numbers expressed in the rectangular coordinates) comprised of a bf real part and a bf imaginary part, and bcp (for complex numbers expressed in the polar coordinates) comprised of a bf radius and a bf angle). Functions supported include real and complex versions of: basic arithmetic, trigonometric functions, log and exponential functions, hyperbolic functions and the inverses of all of these, base conversions between bases up to 64, conversions between rectangular and polar coordinates, and some special functions such as Euler, Bernoulli, Gamma, Zeta, and BesselJ. The library also includes a 'bd' (for bigdecimal) object with fractional base 10 digits up to long.MaxValue.",
