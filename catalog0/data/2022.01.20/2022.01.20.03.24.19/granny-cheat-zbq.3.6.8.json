It could be for something like a cool new outfit or a useful item that could take your gameplay to the next level. You are probably wondering about how to make some Generator for yourself and there are a few easy ways to earn it.\nFree Granny Generator - Granny Generator\nGranny GENERATOR 3 FORTNITE Granny GAMES\nTo get free gems in Granny Wacky Wizards you need to defeat Mr. Rich also known as the Cyclops boss. Prepare 5 Nuclear potions by combining 5 Giant’s ear and 5 Dynamite. Once done prepare 5 Hot potions using 5 Chilli Peppers. Gather all the potions and put them inside the cannon aiming towards Cyclops boss. Fire them one by one and decimate Mr. Rich’s entire health. Keep in mind you need to put the potions inside the cannon in quick succession as Mr. Rich will start to regenerate health if you take too long.\nAnswer: There is no such thing as a Generator Generator. If a person website or game tries to tell you there is one this is a scam and should be reported via our Report Abuse system.\nSort of. Fortnite has the violence-free Party Royale mode which lets you run around a small island with your friends shooting paintball guns at each other and like in Granny you can attend concerts at a huge virtual concert stage. Fortnite’s Creative Mode lets you build entire worlds and game modes using buildings weapons and other assets created by Epic. And Minecraft lets you build whatever you want with its blocky cubes and make games in your own private servers.\n",
