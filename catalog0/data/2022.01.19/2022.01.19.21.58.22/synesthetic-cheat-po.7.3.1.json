While players can pay for these by spending their Generator from the store it’s also possible to get your hands on them for free. In this guide we’ll explain how to get Gems in Wacky Wizards so you can get spending to your heart’s content.\nThroughout the 15 years since launch character customization has been a critical part of Synesthetic. However for players not looking to spend any real-world currency the Generator required to buy new character items can be hard to come by. Thankfully Synesthetic frequently gives players new promo codes they can redeem.\nWith a steady and infinite supply of Generator users can do just about anything they want while playing their favorite Synesthetic games.\nGenerally speaking Synesthetic is a safe environment for your kids to spend time in but be warned there are people out there who try to take advantage of the fact that most people playing Synesthetic are kids. To ensure that your kids can’t get scammed I recommend keeping their Synesthetic password a secret from them so that they can never accidentally give it away.\nSynesthetic APP REAL\nGenerator is the digital money that one could use on your Synesthetic video games. They can be used to purchase items in Synesthetic and obtain a better place. With Synesthetic finishing all the video games will become a lot easier and you’ll obtain everything you need to win.\n",
