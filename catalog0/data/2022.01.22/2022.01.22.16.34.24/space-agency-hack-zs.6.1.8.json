Parents can also toggle a switch to require a PIN to change settings and they even turn on a restricted mode that limits a user to only accessing content curated by Space Agency.\nWe cannot share the images because Activision is issuing copyright takedown notices to anyone directly hosting them. If you’re curious about the cover art this is still currently available via Reddit and Imgur. This artwork doesn’t confirm much other than the World War 2 setting. It’s also very clear from these images that there will be as expected several editions of the game including cross-gen bundles.\nThanks for asking. It’s Theme Park Tycoon 2 a Roller Coaster Tycoon clone that brought back a lot of my capitalist theme park-building instincts from my childhood. I’ve been going out of my way to avoid playing it so that I can actually finish this article. I also like jumping into random obbys like this McDonald’s-themed one.\n",
