  "description": "xBIM PropertySets is part of the xBIM Toolkit that implements buildingSMART schema for property and quantity sets. It can be used to load the descriptive data about properties and/or\n\t\t  quantities and create real properties and quantities based on these definitions. This library implements Ifc2x3 and IFC4.\n\t\t  \n          xBIM is an Open Source Toolkit for developing IFC based applications (BuildingSmart Data model). \n          3.0 contains a new geometry engine that has a full API to allow geometry constructions, boolean operations and meshing.\n          It provides full support for reading and writing geometry, topology and data in accordance with the Ifc2x3 schema.\n          xBIM reads and writes Ifc, IfcXMl and IfcZip formats.\n          The xBIM project provides packages to convert IFC models to COBie spreadsheets in both UK and US cultures as well as a range of 3D viewing controls for use with Windows forms, WPF, WEBGL and OpenGL platforms.\n          IOS and Android versions are under development.",
