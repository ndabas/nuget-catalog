  "description": "Commands simplifies coordination of asynchronous and synchronous activities. The library is built upon class Command, which represents an action. A Command may be run synchronously or asynchronously, and may be aborted.\n\nParallelCommands, itself a Command, executes a collection of commands concurrently (in parallel), and SequentialCommands executes its commands in sequence. Using these classes, it's possible to create a deep nesting of coordinated actions. For example, SequentialCommands can hold instances of ParallelCommands, which in turn could hold SequentialCommands, and any other Command-derived object.\n\nTaskCommand, DelegateCommand and Command.AsTask() offer easy integration with Tasks and delegates.\n\nPeriodicCommand repeats its action at a given interval, ScheduledCommand runs once at a specific time, and RecurringCommand runs at times that are provided via a callback.\n\nRetryableCommand offers the option to keep retrying a failed command until the caller has had enough, and TimeLimitedCommand fails with a timeout exception if a given duration elapses before the command finishes execution.\n\nAll of the above Command classes are simply containers for other Command objects that presumably do something of interest. They can be combined in ways that offer a lot of customization. For example, to make an HttpRequest at a given time, with a timeout and a configurable number of retries, you could create a ScheduledCommand containing a RetryableCommand which contains a TimeLimitedCommand which contains an HttpRequestCommand.\n      \nCommands includes a few Command classes that might be commonly useful, including PauseCommand and HttpRequestCommand, but it is expected that users of this library will create their own Command-derived classes.\n\n\nGuidelines for developing your own Command-derived class:\n\n- If the implementation of your command is naturally synchronous, inherit from SyncCommand\n\n- If the implementation of your command is naturally asynronous and makes use of await, inherit from TaskCommand\n\n- If the implementation of your command is naturally asynchronous but does not make use of await, inherit from AsyncCommand\n\n- Make your implementation responsive to abort requests. To do this, make ocassional calls to Command.CheckAbortFlag() or Command.AbortRequested.\n\n\nVersions for C++ and Java exist at https://github.com/efieleke/CommandLibForCPP.git and https://github.com/efieleke/CommandLibForJava.git.",
