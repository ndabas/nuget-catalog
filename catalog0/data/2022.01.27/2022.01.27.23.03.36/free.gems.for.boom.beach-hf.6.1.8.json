They say that anyone asking you to input your details anywhere is scamming you and that you won’t receive a glitched account or FREE GEMS FOR BOOM BEACH. The terms of service also warn against it too. They say that you cannot obtain “exploited game or experience content.” This includes hacked accounts with Generator. If you’re caught doing this they reserve the right to immediately close your account.\nTherefore using a FREE GEMS FOR BOOM BEACH account generator isn’t worth the risk. They can be unreliable and dangerous and could get your account shut down.\nFree Coins,Free Gems,Free Diamonds,Free Spins, free coins generator no human verification\n",
