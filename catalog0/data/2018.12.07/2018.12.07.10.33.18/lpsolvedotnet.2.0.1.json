  "releaseNotes": "- [2.0.1] Fixes issue #3: Native binaries are not copied when project is built with property OutDir=some_path.\n      - LpSolve is now a class with instance methods instead of just a static class. It still has static factory methods to create the LP.\n      - Use right enum types to pass to methods.\n      - Use IntPtr in a few more places that were forgotten.\n      - Removed methods that according to lpsolve  API docs were either internal or non-functioning. http://lpsolve.sourceforge.net/5.5/\n      - Do not build with \"unsafe\" mode anymore.",
