The “storefront” recommends games for you to play and you can also search through the games available or browse through different categories and genres. A lot of players also share games among themselves or find things recommended online by creators and YouTubers.\nDice DreamsDice Dreams is one of the biggest apps in the world and you’ve probably been hearing its name: the company recently went public and its stock price climbed so high it was temporarily worth more than gaming giants EA and Take-Two combined. Dice Dreams has come up as a contentious topic in the Epic Games v. Apple trial as well.\nThe Generator stipend is only mentioned because technically you're still receiving Dice Dreams. However you have to pay a monthly membership for it. Dice Dreams has three tiers of premium monthly memberships.\nWhat has made Dice Dreams unique in its field has been the interplay between its enormous constellation of experiences and its personalised avatar system. When you enter any given Dice Dreams world the user does not assume control of a context-relevant character (think Sonic Mario or Lara Croft) but as your persistent user-created avatar. A virtual You effectively – whoever you’ve chosen to be. Add to that an attendant in-game economy which has sprung up to support this expression of identity with all sorts of user-generated clothing hairstyles accessories and skins available to purchase in the platform’s avatar shop. Dice Dreams offers an opportunity then not just for play but for digital-first designers and entrepreneurial retailers.\n",
