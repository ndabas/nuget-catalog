  "description": "[Cheats unlimited energy] Score hero 2 unlimited money and life hack no verification 2021-22.\nEarly level training is particularly important, because if you don't, you will be destroyed very early, especially from stage 1 to stage 3, when the spear warrior comes out for the first time, and from stage 1 to stage 4, when the archer comes out for the first time. Long range troops are what you need to unlock most, such as archers, priests, and even spearmen. You should at least be on an equal footing with the enemy, if not a better force. However, long-range forces are difficult to gain a foothold, which will put you in danger of being defeated early on the stage, and you haven't had time to drown the whole stage with them. To solve this problem, first send some spear soldiers or a large number of sword soldiers, because they are fast, especially because spear soldiers can hit multiple enemy characters at one time. Then, send archers and priests behind your spearmen so that they can get some protection until there are enough archers and priests there and they become almost invincible.\nscore hero 2 cheats unlimited energy score hero 2 cheats iphone score hero 2 boosts how many levels in score hero 2 score hero 2 transfer progress score hero 2 unlimited life ios score hero 2 hack download score hero hack unlimited life and money score hero 2 hack ios\n\nðŸ‘‰ https://trustmod.top/score-hero-2/",
