  "description": "DBreeze features:\n\n- Fully managed code, platform independent and without reference to other libraries. \n- ACID compliant. \n- Multi-threaded, with a solution for deadlocks resolving/elimination, parallel reads and synchronized writes/reads. \n- No fixed scheme for table names (construction and access on the fly).\n- Tables can reside in mixed locations: different folders, hard drives, memory.\n- Database indexes (keys) never need to be defragmented. Speed of insert/update/remove operations doesn't grow up during the time.\n- Ability to access Key/Value pair of a table by physical link, what can economize time for joining necessary data structures.\n- No limits for database size (except \"long\" size for each table and physical resources constraints).\n- Low memory and physical space consumption, also while random inserts and updates. Updates reside the same physical space, if possible.\n- High performance of CRUD operations. When you need, unleash DBreeze power and get 500000 key/value pairs insert or 260K updates per second per core into sorted table on the hard drive of standard PC.\n- High speed of random keys batch insert and updates (batch must be sorted in memory ascending and non-overwrite flag must be set).\n- Range selects / Traversing (Forward, Backward, From/To, Skip, StartsWith etc). Remove keys, change keys.\n- Keys and values, on the low level, are always byte arrays. \n- Max. key size is 65KB, max. value size is 2GB. Value can be represented as a set of columns, where can be stored data types of fixed or dynamic length. Every dynamic datablock can be of size 2GB. \n- Rich set of conversion functions from/to between byte[] and other data types.\n- Nested / Fractal tables which can reside inside of master tables values.\n- Incremental backup/restore option.\n- DBreeze is a foundation for complex data storage solutions (graph/neuro, object, document, text search etc. data layers). Please, study documentation to understand all abilities of DBreeze.",
