  "description": "How to Watch the 2022 24 Hours of Daytona\n\nLINK HERE>> https://helal-sports.blogspot.com/2022/01/rolex_29.html\n\nIMSA's season-opening Rolex 24 at Daytona is here, and all 24 hours will again be broadcast live. However, the closing of NBC Sports Network has made what was already a confusing labyrinth of network television, cable, and streaming windows more confusing than ever. If you want to watch the 24 Hours of Daytona, this is where you'll need to be looking.\n\nThe entire race will be available for streaming on NBC's streaming platform Peacock, but most of the event will also be shown live on television. Segments shown on network TV will air on NBC itself, while the portions that would have previously aired on NBC Sports Network will instead be found on USA. Yes, the former home of Monk and Suits is now one of the key broadcasting partners for every major racing series in America. The sections not airing on television will air exclusively on Peacock, which can be found online or on an app available on most smart TVs.\n\n2021 race winners Wayne Taylor Racing will start from overall pole for Acura when the race goes green, a result they won in a sprint race last weekend. TR3 Racing's Lamborghini Huracan will lead the field in GTD Pro.",
