  "description": "DISCLAIMER: This is an \"unchecked\" version of the Hippie library, that is, it is a release where all integrity checks have been stripped away to achieve the best performance. Use this instead of the original Hippie library IF AND ONLY IF you are certain that your code does not rely on those integrity checks and that it never violates them.\n      Fully managed library providing five types of heap. It implements d-ary, binary, binomial, fibonacci and pairing heaps, in order to let the user choose the best heap to fit her needs. Each heap has its own advantages and disadvantages: please see the documentation or Wikipedia to better understand how those data structures work and how they behave in each operation.",

  "releaseNotes": "* Fixed a bug in binomial heap.\n      * More unit tests (which, of course, are not shipped with this package).\n      * Implemented methods to get the forest underlying the heap itself. Those methods should be used to study the structure of the heap, maybe with the help of a graphical tester (we are planning to implement it).",
