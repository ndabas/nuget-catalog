  "description": "Mobile Legends Free [Gift] Card Codes Generator 2022 :\n\nCLICK HERE TO HACK >>> https://gamebowl.xyz/mobilelegends~dae\n\nDo you like free in-game loot and useful freebies that don't require you to do pretty much anything in order to redeem? Then I'm sure these Mobile Legends redeem codes are exactly what you've been looking for! Many games nowadays offer free loot as compensation either after maintenance or as an event reward, and Mobile Legends doesn't shy away from them either. There have been countless codes so far, but we're only going to go over the latest ones since they are the ones most likely still working. But before we dive into them, let me explain how exactly you can claim these redeem codes, because it's not as easy as opening an option in-game and typing in the code!  How to redeem codes in Mobile Legends? To redeem codes, you'll first have to open the game and the Mobile Legends code exchange page. In game, you will have to find your account ID. You can find that by tapping on your profile icon, and on the right side of the screen you'll notice a long number, in this format: \"ID: 123456789 (12345)\". The number you want to use is the one in bold. Write down that number on the website, in the Game ID box, and then tap on Send. You will receive an in-game mail with a code, which you can then copy + paste in the Verification Code box on the website. Type in the code you got, which is valid for 30 minutes, and start typing in the codes and then tap on Redeem. Your rewards should arrive in your in-game mailbox shortly!
