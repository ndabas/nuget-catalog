  "releaseNotes": "This is the standard version which has no pro-active support (except issues). Also available: Professional version and Enterprise version (includes source code). Contact the authors on NuGet.\nThis Release:\n- NET 4.0 support added.\n- Improved read/write access to storage locations at runtime.\n- APTCA added to the assembly and compliance to the Security-Transparent Code (Level 2) rules.\n- Added maxLength to the Images configuration. Images above this limit (bytes) will be stored directly with a generic thumbnail and are not handled in the image processing sub pipeline. \n- Added forceObjectContext attribute [true|false] (default: false) to the security configuration. If true, a client must send an objectContext with a request.\n   \nBug fixes:\n- Issue #21, #22, #23 resolved, where an exception occured while trying to read readonly files.\n- Issue #20 resolved, where in some environments uploading very large files (> 200MB) could cause an out of memory exception.\n- Issue #17 resolved, where initialization of the component fails in some environments.\n- Issue with urls resolved, where backload generates a wrong url if the application runs in a virtual or sub directory of web root.",
