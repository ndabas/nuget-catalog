  "description": "Dragon stones hack DBZ generator:\n\nDragon Ball Legends Hack Although it's also possible to ignore characters that you already own, they're useful later after you upgrade existing characters to the Z Power level. Besides, it's also possible to unlock new characters by completing story events. These time-limited tasks usually reward an inconsiderable amount of Z Power to a certain figure linked to the big event after you finish the initial mission or complete the big event quest. These tasks are often simple, such as as an example fighting employing a specific character ten times. So make sure you regularly check the daily missions and try to attain the powerful figures as much as possible.\n\n\nHACK HERE >>> https://lucymods.com/dragon-ball-z\n\n\nDragon Ball Legends Hack Users can just only unlock new Boost Panels with Zeni and Soul by completing chapters in the storyline.
