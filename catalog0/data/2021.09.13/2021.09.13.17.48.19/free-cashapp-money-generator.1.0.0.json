  "description": "FREE CASH APP MONEY GENERATOR No Human Verification:\n\nThis cash app hack includes promising to find you a cheap flat or offering an apartment at a much slower speed than normal, but demanding you to ship them a deposit first (e.g., before touring the prospective rental). Never send money to somebody you never understand who is promising to deliver you something at a subsequent time - like the apartment leasing.\nIf you fail to verify who someone is or the validity of what they are offering, it's probably a scam. \n\n\nVISIT HERE >>>>> https://giftcrow.com/cashapp-new\n\nCash App is made in 2015 as Square Cash, is really a mobile app designed for sending and receiving money.
