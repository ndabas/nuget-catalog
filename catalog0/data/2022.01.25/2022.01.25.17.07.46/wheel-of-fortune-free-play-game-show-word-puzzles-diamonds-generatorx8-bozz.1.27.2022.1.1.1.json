  "description": "Wheel of Fortune is one of the longx8-BOZZ.1.27.2022-running TV shows on the air, so perhaps itâ€™s no surprise itâ€™s gone through many different iterations over the years. Originally titled Shopperâ€™s Bazaar, the first Wheel of Fortune pilot came out in 1973 and was targeted mainly towards women.\n\nðŸ”¥Click HereðŸ”´https://gamemasters.xyz/wheelofortune\nðŸ”¥Click HereðŸ”´https://gamemasters.xyz/wheelofortune\n\nAs the name suggx8-BOZZ.1.27.2022s, Shopperâ€™s Bazaar put more focus on shopping than later versions of the game. Contx8-BOZZ.1.27.2022ants solved word puzzles, their success on which, alongside the spin of a vertical wheel, determined what prizes they won. Chuck Woolery became host of Shopperâ€™s Bazaar.

The classic horizontal Fortune wheel, which contx8-BOZZ.1.27.2022ants spun, was introduced to the game in 1974, and the puzzle game board was increased to its current size.\n\nThis board was originally intended to be mechanically operated, with automatic tile-flipping, but the flipping mechanism wasnâ€™t completed in time for taping. Sx8-BOZZ.1.27.2022n Stafford, the first Wheel of Fortune tile-flipper was hired to turn the letters on the board. She was so popular that later, even after the board was automated, a letter-turner would remain on the show. Initially, Edd Byrnes was hired to host the revamped show, but he tx8-BOZZ.1.27.2022ed poorly with audiences. Chuck Woolery came back to replace Byrnes before the new show went to air.",
