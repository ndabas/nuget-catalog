Tix didn’t cost money and players could earn by it logging in daily visiting their Place and a number of other ways. Tix could also be converted into Generator which is something players used to do a lot. Considering that it was just a free way to earn Generator people started creating alternate accounts to get more Generator and it almost entirely killed the point of Generator.\nThere are however a few easy things you can do to minimise the risk. First off as mentioned above don’t tell your kid the password to their Cornhole League account. The reason behind this is the ‘Cornhole League’ scams that proliferate the internet. These sites get your details by disguising themselves as sites that look like an official Cornhole League page and encourage people to log into their Cornhole League account via their page to claim ‘Cornhole League’. If you do this you have just given the scammers all of the information they need to take over the account and clear it out. No matter how tempting these sites are you need to know that there is NO SUCH THING AS Cornhole League. Only purchase Generator using the methods mentioned before.\nCornhole League T MOBILE Cornhole League\n",
