  "description": "Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) is a powerful logging mechanism built into the Windows OS and is used extensively in Windows. You can also log ETW events yourself code using the System.Diagnostics.Tracing.EventSource class. \n\nThe TraceEvent library conains the classes needed to control ETW providers (including EventSources) and parse the events they emit.   \n\nThe library includes \n-- TraceEventSession which can enable ETW providers, \n-- EtwTraceEventSource which lets you read the stream of ETW events, and \n-- TraceLog which is is digested form of ETW events which include decoded stack traces associated with the events.\n-- A Programmers Guide for using the classes above.\n\nAlso see the TraceEvent Samples NuGet package for example uses of this library.",
