  "releaseNotes": "Version 3.0\nThis Version has a new build in Validation Engine. This Engine is a replacement of the former used HashTables with Validation support. The new Validation Engine offers additional Validation and Repair Options and manages Cross references between CAEX-Elements. The Old HashTables are still available to be downward compatibel.\n\nIn Version 3.0 the most Element Creation and Insertion Methods are provided with an additional Parameter that allows the explicit definition, wether a new Element is inserted as the first Element of it's Type or the Last Element of it's Type in the Children Collection of it's Parent. The Default Behavior has not changed to former versions, where the Insertion Position in most methods was the first.\n\n\n\n\n\nVersion 2.2 \nThis version uses an updated Altova Kernel\n\nBetter Performance when large Trees are\nwalked. Use of Recursion is avoided for those walks. The .Net 4.0 Version uses Parallel for Consistency Checks.\n------------------------------------------\n\nVersion 2.1.5\n\nMethod to redirect links for mirrors and internal links complete redesigned for better performance.\n\nReferencing of CAEX Elementnames which contain special characters (i.e. in InternalLinks) are now handled as defined in the CAEX guide. \n\nNew Methods two get derived Interfaces and derived SupportedRoleClasses (similar to the Method to get derived Attributes).",
