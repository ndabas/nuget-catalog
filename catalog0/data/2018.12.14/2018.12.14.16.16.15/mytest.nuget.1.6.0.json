  "releaseNotes": "• And() extension method to TimeSpanConversionExtensions to support 4.Hours().And(30.Minutes()).\n         • More TimeSpan extensions to fluently create a TimeSpan like  23.Hours(59.Minutes()).And(20.Seconds()).\n         • Support for Mspec as contributed by Urs Enzler.\n         • Support for the ComparisonMode to assert inner exception messages as well. Also added ComparisonMode Equivalent and EquivalentSubstring to assert that the message of an (inner) exception matches a certain case-insensitive phrase.\n         • Guid assertions like Be(), NotBe(), BeEmpty() and NotBeEmpty().\n         • Support for recursively comparing the properties of nested objects using ShouldHave().AllProperties().IncludingNestedObjects().EqualTo().\n         • Type and MethodInfo assertions for asserting class members are virtual or decorated with specific attributes.\n         • Before and After extensions methods for TimeSpans .\n         • Should().Be() and NotBe() extensions to the TypeAssertions.\n         • PDB files to the release build as another contribution by Urs Enzler.\n         • The name of the property to the ShouldFirePropertyChanged extension method failure message, also contributed by Urs Enzler.\n         • Added comments to some of the assertion classes.\n         • Fixed a stack overflow exception due to a recursive call between the various overloads of floating point extension method BeApproximately()\n         • While comparing two collections for equality, FA didn't check any superfluous items in the expected collection.\n         • Boolean assertions did not properly check against null values.\n         • Fixed a stack overflow exception while creating a displayable representation of an object  that contains circular references.\n         • Fixed some potential memory leaks fix in MonitorEvents() using a patch provided by Remo Gloor.\n         • Sometimes the wrong name of a the property or type was reported in a failure message.\n         • ShouldHave().AllProperties().EqualTo() sometimes treated two objects that are functional equivalent according to their Equals() override as different, simply because they were not of the same type.\n         • Fixed the detection of collection items that appear in the wrong order in Should().ContainInOrder().",
