  "releaseNotes": "New functionality:\n⦁ New controls: StswTimerControl, StswLabelPanel.\n⦁ New adorner: StswRippleAdorner. It is used to enable a new click effect to most Stsw controls, especially the buttons (they already have it enabled by default) and can be set through StswControl's \"EnableRippleEffect\" attached property.\n⦁ New classes: StswNaturalStringComparer (to provide a natural string comparison that sorts string in a \"human-expected\" order), StswStoreBase (base model for stores), StswStoreChangedArgs (for stores).\n⦁ StswDatabases has new config property where all configuration has been moved (StswDatabaseConfig supports auto disposing connections, setting delimiters for mappings, changing file path for importing and exporting lists, enabling less space queries, returning if designer mode).\n⦁ StswMailboxes has new config property where all configuration has been moved (StswMailboxesConfig supports global email address for debug mode, disabling mail sending, changing file path for importing and exporting lists).\n⦁ StswExport has new method for exporting IXLWorksheet to html code string named \"ExportToHtml\".\n⦁ New extensions and functions: ToDictionarySafely (converts a collection to a dictionary, safely handling duplicate keys by ignoring subsequent duplicates), Next (finds the next occurrence of a specified day of the week after a given date), GetDescription (retrieves the description attribute from an enum value, if present), Batch (splits a collection into smaller batches of the specified size), Shuffle (randomizes the order of elements in a list), IsSimilarTo (simple comparing the string representations of property values), FindLogicalChild (finds the first logical child of a specific type for the given control).\n\nChanged functionality:\n⦁ StswHeader renamed into StswLabel. For backward compatibility, it exists with two different names in this version, but older one is marked as obsolete.\n⦁ StswSubHeader renamed into StswSubLabel.\n⦁ StswMessageDialog has a little changed template (to make details button look better).\n⦁ StswCancellableAsyncCommand no longer have action on cancel as parameter.\n⦁ StswShiftButton remade into StswShiftSelector.\n⦁ StswDropArrow's icon can be changed now. Additionaly its visibility in other controls from now on is controled only by StswControl's \"IsArrowless\" attached property and no longer controled by dynamic resource named \"StswDropArrow.Visibility\".\n⦁ StswComboBox implements IStswSelectionControl interface.\n⦁ StswDatabaseHelper's \"Set\" method has been reworked.\n⦁ Importing and exporting lists in StswDatabases, StswMailboxes has been reworked. It works with encrypted json now and can work asynchronously. StswLog also has async methods now and can auto disable logging if there was enough failed attempts.\n⦁ Removed extensions and functions: Remove (for IEnumerable), SerializeToJson, DeserializeFromJson.\n⦁ Changed extensions and functions: ToHex (it always returns color in hex - before it could return name of color), Between (reversed order can be allowed), ShiftIndexBy renamed into ShiftBy, GetProcessUser renamed into GetUser (and made into extension).\n⦁ ParametersAddList method is limited to max. 20 elements.\n\nBugfixes:\n⦁ IsInDebug method should better determine if entry assembly was built in debug mode.\n⦁ Stsw sub controls also have nullable \"IsBusy\" property to allow them to automatically bind to command's \"IsBusy\" property (similar to what StswLabel has).\n⦁ Bugfix for archiving logs.",
