  "description": "This library implements an in-process database for storing and retrieving class objects and their property values. The library is designed to be as easy to use as possible with a small public API. The backing storage is Azure Table Storage, so Azure account credentials are required to use the library. This library is an experimental but compatible and fully working sibling of the Orthogonal.ObjectDb.Esent library which uses an in-process high-performance ESENT database as the backing storage. The ESENT backed database should be used where high-performance is required.",

  "releaseNotes": "This release contains no code changes, it simply removes the AssemblyInformationalVersion attribute from the assembly. The presence of this attribute puts an unacceptable value in the nuspec version variable, which breaks the nuget.org browse results and all uploads after 2.0.1 were invisible and uninstallable.",
