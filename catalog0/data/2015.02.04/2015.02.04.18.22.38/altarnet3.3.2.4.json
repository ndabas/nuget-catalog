  "description": "AltarNet3 (or AN3 for short) is a library that facilitate the creation of TCP servers/clients, along with UDP. TCP connections can be secured via SSL, with only a few easy steps.\n\nIt comes with a powerful FTP manager, taking advantage of .NET 4.5's new asynchronous pattern (Async/Await), featuring cancellable requests and download/upload progress monitoring.\n\nAlso comes with a 'single instance' and a 'thread safety' helper.",

  "releaseNotes": "3.2.4.0 :\n- Improved upon the TCP message framing handler, also fixed some potential issues with it;\n- The recycling of TcpFragments is now actually 100%, it wasn't in the previous version;\n- A TcpFragment no longer have the property IgnoreFullEvent. However, a TcpClientInfo still got ReadNextNotBuffered, as described in the previous changelog;\n- Increased the default read buffer size for TCP clients and server's clients to 16KB each, up from 4KB;\n- The buffer size can be set when creating a TCP client or server;\n\n3.2.3.0 :\n- The SendFile(Async) method of the TCP client / server actually work now. (Note to self : test with bigger files)\n- Added a property to the TcpClientInfo class named ReadNextNotBuffered, which basically work like ReadNextAsLong. It set the next packet received to ignore the ReceivedFull event. Useful for file transfer and streaming.\n- A TCP read timeout now properly disconnect with the fixes of 3.2.2.0.\n- TcpFragments are now 100% recycled, therefore less garbage to collect.\n\n3.2.2.0 :\n- Fixed a few problems with disconnections;\n- Added a way to disconnect via a TcpClientInfo.\n\n3.2.1.0 :\n- Overall improvements in sending the length of a TCP message, by taking into account the 'network to host / host to network' byte ordering;\n- Added a property for a TCP server / client named IsLengthInOneFrame, which combine the usual two writes when sending a message, into one;\n- The TCP event ReceiveError specifically ignore a few exceptions, which are normal occurrances;\n- Very slight improvements in TCP packet handling;\n- Improved the synchronization when a TCP server or client start receiving messages, so that if you send a message immediately after being connected, it won't have a chance to be ignored;\n- The ThreadSafeHelper's Release method now do nothing when the key does not exist;\n\n3.2.0.0 :\n- Largely improved SSL support;\n- Added an SSL Helper class (named SslHelper) with a method to get or create a self-signed certificate (and add it to the local cert store), in one simple line;\n- Improved SendFile method for both TCP server and client, with an added asynchronous version;\n- Added SendAllFile to TcpServerHandler;\n- The method WriteToStreamAsync from TcpFragment is now obsolete, use WriteToStream instead.",
