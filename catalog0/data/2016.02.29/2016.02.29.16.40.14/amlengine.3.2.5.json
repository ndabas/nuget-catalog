  "releaseNotes": "Version 3.2.5\nBugfix for method InternalElementType.CreateSystemUnitClass \n\nAccessors for Subattributes of  FrameAttributeType added.\n\nVersion 3.2.4\nError in Initialization of FrameValues corrected and Frame DataType set to null.\n\nVersion 3.2.1 - correction of 3.2.0 changes\nNew Methods to set and get Attribute Values with their .net DataType. For this, the xsd-Schema type is mapped to a .net DataType and a string conversion is performed. The CAEX Wrapper Type AttributeType provides get and set Methods for Double and DateTime - Types and a generic get Method, which tries to apply a string to type conversion for any of the xsd-Schema-Types if the type information is defined in the AttributeDataType-Field. The FrameAttribute Type does no longer use the FormatInformation - this property is obsolete. See documentation of methods for details.\n\nVersion 3.2\nFrame attribute default format is \".\" as decimal separator and 2 decimal digits. Change this with FormatInformation in FrameAttributeType.\n\nbugs in validation engine fixed\n\nmissing wrapper creation methods for some types are added.\n\nVersion 3.1.4\nCAEXPath Method returns wrong path for ExternalInterface\nProperty ManagedByApplication of CAEXTables renamed due to spelling error\nOverload Methods for CaexBasicObject.Descendants (additional parameter for create delegate), avoids reflection.\n\nVersion 3.1.3\nIncreased Performance when accessing Object Tables\n\nVersion 3.1.2\nnew method to create InternalLinks and ExternalInterfaceClasses together: \npublic static InternalLinkType CreateInternalLink\n\nVersion 3.1.1\nBug-Fix in RefURIAttributeType\n\nVersion 3.1\nOfficial Release Version of the AMLEngine\n\nVersion 3.0.3\nBug Fixes\n\n\nVersion 3.0\nThis Version has a new build in Validation Engine. This Engine is a replacement of the former used HashTables with Validation support. The new Validation Engine offers additional Validation and Repair Options and manages Cross references between CAEX-Elements. The Old HashTables are still available to be downward compatibel.\n\nIn Version 3.0 the most Element Creation and Insertion Methods are provided with an additional Parameter that allows the explicit definition, wether a new Element is inserted as the first Element of it's Type or the Last Element of it's Type in the Children Collection of it's Parent. The Default Behavior has not changed to former versions, where the Insertion Position in most methods was the first.\n\n\n\n\n\nVersion 2.2 \nThis version uses an updated Altova Kernel\n\nBetter Performance when large Trees are\nwalked. Use of Recursion is avoided for those walks. The .Net 4.0 Version uses Parallel for Consistency Checks.\n------------------------------------------\n\nVersion 2.1.5\n\nMethod to redirect links for mirrors and internal links complete redesigned for better performance.\n\nReferencing of CAEX Elementnames which contain special characters (i.e. in InternalLinks) are now handled as defined in the CAEX guide. \n\nNew Methods two get derived Interfaces and derived SupportedRoleClasses (similar to the Method to get derived Attributes).",
