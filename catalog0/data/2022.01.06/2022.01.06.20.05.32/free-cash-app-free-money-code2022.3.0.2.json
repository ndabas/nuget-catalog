  "description": "Cash App, the massively popular mobile peer-to-peer payment app developed by Jack Dorsey's Square has witnessed a rapid growth of users since launching in 2015 and currently boasts over 40 million users.\n\nClick Here to get access:  https://gamesapp.pro/cashapp \n\nClick Here to get access:  https://gamesapp.pro/cashapp \n\nOffering a safe way for users to transfer money, whether it's paying your roommate your share of utilities this month, splitting dinner out with friends, or tip your hairstylist, Cash App and its biggest competitor, Venmo have completely transformed the way we pay for items and exchange money.\n\nCurrently, the app offers users the ability to cash out their payments into a bank account or have it transferred directly to a credit card for a small fee.\n\nWith the addition of a new service, Cash App users are now able to buy and sell cryptocurrencies on the platform.  What's more, is Square plans on doing this legally. The company has been seeking out New York banking charters that would allow them to operate as an official \"bank\" within the state which would give them access to expanded financial services.\n\nAlthough there are many scammers online boasting there are ways to get free money on Cash App there's truly only one way (outside of taking advantage of Cash App's user referral program).  It's 100% legal and it's dead simple to do.\n\nUse the Yotta debit card as the source of funds whenever you make a payment on Cash App.  With the Yotta debit card every single purchase has a chance to be immediately reimbursed, no strings attached.  This works at any retailer, but many aren't aware this also works on Cash App.",
