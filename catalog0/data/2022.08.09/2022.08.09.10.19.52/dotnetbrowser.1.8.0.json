  "releaseNotes": "DotNetBrowser 1.8 comes with the following features and improvements:\n\nUpgrade to Chromium 51. The major change in this release is upgrading the Chromium engine to version 51.0.2704.106. \nImproved the process of creating a screenshot of the complete web page in the lightweight mode. We have added the OnRedraw event to the DrawingView, and this event resolves the threading issue with OnRepaint event. The OnRedraw event is fired on the main event thread, so the captured image can be obtained in the same thread and there is no need to invoke GetImage() in the main thread. \nAdded possibility to modify upload data: now API allows to access and modify POST/PUT/PATCH upload data before sending it to a web server.\nAdded mouse simulation support. Now it is possible to simulate mouse movement, scroll and clicks even for an off-screen Browser.\nAdded native crash handler: now it is possible to be notified about the native process crash. In previous versions, the dump file was generated silently on native process crash and the component simply stopped functioning. The crash handler gives a possibility for your application to be notified about this. As a result, your application can stop working with the crashed component. \nFixed default file chooser: now the file chooser is capable to recognize acceptable file types. The default implementation of the file chooser in previous versions was not able to recognize acceptable file types and allowed to accept files of any type.\nFixed mouse movement latency. In previous versions you may notice that the component is working slower if a number of mouse events (clicks or movements) are generated. In the new version the number of mouse events will not cause latency in component rendering.\n",
