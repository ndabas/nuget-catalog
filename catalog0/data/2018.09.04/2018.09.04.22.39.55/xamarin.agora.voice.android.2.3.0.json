  "releaseNotes": "v2.3.0 (Released Aug 31st, 2018)\nBefore Reading\nFrom v2.3.0, the LiveTranscoding Class was relocated from the io.agora.live package to the io.agora.rtc.live package.\n\nA spelling mistake was corrected in API constants.java in v2.3.0.\n\nBefore:\npublic static final int SOFEWARE_ENCODER = 1;\nAfter:\npublic static final int SOFTWARE_ENCODER = 1;\nThe security keys are improved and updated in v2.1.0. If you are using an Agora SDK version below v2.1.0 and wish to migrate to the latest version, see Token Migration Guide.\n\nNew Features\n1. Notifies the user that the Token will expire in 30 seconds\nThe SDK returns the onTokenPrivilegeWillExpire callback 30 seconds before a Token expires to notify the app to renew it. When this callback is received, you need to generate a new Token on your server and call renewToken to pass the newly-generated Token to the SDK.\n\n2. Returns user-specific upstream and downstream statistics, including the bitrate, frame rate, packet loss rate and time delay\nThe onRemoteAudioTransportStats callback is added to provide user-specific upstream and downstream statistics, including the bitrate, frame rate, and packet loss rate. During a call or a live broadcast, this callback is triggered every two seconds after the user receives audio packets from a remote user. This callback includes the user ID, audio bitrate at the receiver, packet loss rate, and time delay (ms).\n\nImprovements\nImproved the quality for one-on-one voice/video scenarios with optimized latency and smoothness, especially for areas like Southeast Asia, South America, Africa and Middle East.\nImproved the audio encoder efficiency in a live broadcast to reduce user traffic while ensuring the call quality.\nImproved the audio quality during a call or a live broadcast using the deep-learning algorithm.\nIssues Fixed\nOccassional crashes after interoperating with devices of other platforms from some Android devices.\nExcessive increase in memory usage associated with a host when he/she frequently joins and leaves a channel of multiple delegated hosts.\nOccasional issue that the remote user cannot hear the host when the host swithces to AUDIENCE and then back to BROADCASTER.\nOccasional crashes on the Android devices when the remote users frequently join and leave the channel.\nThe audience cannot adjust the channel volume on some special occasions.\nOccasional issue that applications do not respond on some Android devices.\nOccasional crashes when one of the two broadcasters mutes or disables the local audio while playing the background music.\nOccasional crashes on some devices when preloading the sound effects.\nOccasional issue that an Android client can still interoperate in a communication channel when removed from the dashboard.\nFailure to enable the hardware encoder on some Android devices.\nOccasional crashes on some Android devices when frequently turning on and off the flashlight during a live broadcast.\nOccasional crashes on some Android devices when a user frequently changes the Token.\nOccasional issue on some Android devices that the users cannot see each other.\nOccasional echoes when using a specific audio card.\nAPI Changes\nTo improve user experience, Agora has cleaned up and made the following changes to its APIs:\n\nTo avoid adding too many users with the same UID into the CDN publishing channel, the following API is deleted in v2.3.0, and the type of the return value of addUser is changed from void to int.\n\nsetUser\nThe following APIs are deleted and no longer supported in v2.3.0. Agora provides the Recording SDK for better recording services. For more information on the Recoding SDK, see Release Notes for Agora Recording SDK.\n\nstartRecordingService\nstopRecordingService\nrefreshRecordingServiceStatus\nThe following deprecated APIs are deleted and no longer supported from v2.3.0:\n\nmonitorConnectionEvent\nmonitorBluetoothHeadsetEvent\nmonitorHeadsetEvent\nsetPreferHeadset\nsetSpeakerphoneVolume\nBackwards Compatibility Breaking Changes\nNone.\n\nKnown Issues\nNone.\n\norigin: https://docs.agora.io/en/2.4/product/Voice/Product%20Overview/release_android_audio",
