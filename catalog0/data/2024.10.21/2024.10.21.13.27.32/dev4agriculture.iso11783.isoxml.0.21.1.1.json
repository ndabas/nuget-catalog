  "releaseNotes": "v0.21.1.1:\n  - FIX: We added several definitions for SerialNumber handling in the DeviceGenerator, but we did not add the corresponding definitions in the TCEmulator\n\nv0.21.0.1:\n - FIX: Switching the DataTransferOrign lead to errors as it's static.\n + ADD: Handle Devices with a SerialNumber including Letters.\n -FIX: Ensure that the TaskControllerEmulator always makes the ISOXML use DataTransferOrign MICS, not FMIS\n -FIX: IMPORTANT: We had several First() or Last() calls that might cause throwing errors. We're now using FirstOrDefault() and LastOrDefault(). ATTENTION: If you used the following functions in a TryCatch, you'll now need to check the Result for NULL: \n            - GetDeviceFromDeviceElement: Might now return null\n            - FindDeviceProcessData: Might now return null\n            - FindDeviceProperty: Might now return null\n            - GetDeviceDataDesignator: Might now return \"\"\n            - GetDeviceValuePresentation: Might now return a Default ValuePresentation\n            - IsInField caused crash if no Field exists.\n            - \n\n\nv0.20.1.1:\n- FIX: Several bugs in the non-published version of the TaskController Emulator\n\nv0.20.0.1:\n- ADD: A TaskController Emulator was added to generate ISOXML Like a TaskController would do it.\n\nv0.20.0.0:\n- Internal Release, not published. Base for the TaskController Emulator.\n\nv0.19.6.1\n- FIX: In some ISOXML Folders, There are files that end with TASKDATA.XML but are not actually these files. This happens e.g. with MAC OS files. To avoid errors, we add a warning about that\n\nv0.19.6.1\n- Was not released due to pipeline issues\n\nv0.19.5.5\n- FIX: If an empty or less than 6 bytes BIN-File existed, loading the ISOXML Caused an exception\n\nv0.19.5.4\n- FIX: TryGetDDIValue in Time Elements, Converter to Version 3, Totals and Lifetime Totals might crash in case the coresponding list was empty\n\nv0.19.5.3\n- FIX: Error in case of some function Apps, Fix the error message generation with parameters\n\nv0.19.5.2\n- FIX: In case the DataTransferOrign was MICS, the generated IDs were still positive as the TransferOrign was not handed on to the IDList\n\nv0.19.5.1\n- FIX: In case 2 polygons were compared of which one was closed and one was not, the overlap algorithm might in some cases not recognize the equality of both polygons\nv0.19.5\n+ ADD: Function to check if a field is within bounds.\n\nv0.19.4.1\n-FIX: If a TaskData inside a Zip folder was hidden in multiple subfolders, this lead to loading issues\n\nv0.19.4\n=OPT: This is an optimization Release to better read invalid ISOXML Files and get the maximum out of the data.\n\nv0.19.3.5\n-FIX: The edge case that a TLG is linked twice in a TaskData.XML now doesn't cause a crash but an error in the messages List\n\nv0.19.3.4\n-FIX: Not all elements were read to the IDList; Polygon or LinesTring IDs could have been duplicated\n-FIX: When reading the ISOXML from a string,\n\nv0.19.3.3\n-FIX: Grid-Export to CSV had invalid filename\n\nv0.19.3.3\n-FIX: Grid-Export to CSV had invalid filename\n\nv0.19.3.2\n-FIX: Ensure the path for SaveTLG and SaveGrid is valid.\n\nv0.19.3.1\n+FIX: improved Function to get intersected area\n\nv0.19.3\n+ADD: Function to get intersected area\n\nv0.19.2\n+ADD: Several functions to improve the capabilities of the LinkList Functionalities\n-FIX: The IDs of BaseStation, ProductGroup and ColourLegend were not initialized.\n\nv0.19.1\n+ADD: Get the StopTime for an ASP or TIM, no matter if it exists or needs to be calculated from the Duration.\n\nv0.19.0\n-FIX: Make sure to remove LineStringId in V3 TaskSets\n-FIX: Make sure to limit amount of digits to 9 for GuidancePattern Linestrings.\n\nv0.18.0\n-FIX: The ProductAllocation was the only element in a Task having an ASP instead of AllocationStamp in parameter. Fixed in XSD and therefore also in Lib\n-FIX: The LinkList-File doesn't export any NameSpace headers anymore\n-FIX: Several Points and  Positions may only have up to 9 digits. \n\nv0.17.3\n=OPT: Optimize algorithm to find CulturalPractice in a Task\n+ADD: Functions to read durations\n\nv0.17.2.1\n\n+FIX: add check if no elements with DDI179 \n\nv0.17.2\n\n+ADD: GetTaskCulturalPractice in ISOTaskAnalysis\n\nv0.17.1\n\n+ADD: Specific Exception for missing TaskData.xml. \n\nv0.17.0\n\n+ADD: Adjust CodeGeneration from Schema files to remove Parenthesis-Text\n+FIX: ISOPartField area calculation\n\nv0.16.3\n\n+ADD: Convert any ISOXML Element to an XML String\n\nv0.16.2.2\n\n-FIX: When reading an invalid XML, the Load-Function threw an exception\n\nv0.16.2.1\n\n-FIX: Found a DataSet with AFE-Elements as XFRs. Those are not officially supported but we shouldn't crash when we find them\n-FIX: The resolution of the DDIs was wrong\n\nv0.16.2\n\n-ADD: Functions to get IsoField area\n\nv0.16.1\n\n-FIX: GridFile values were unsigned and GetSetpointValue was problematic\n\nv0.15.2.1\n\n-FIX: MixUp in the Enum of Trigger Methods lead to mixUp between Thresholds and OnChange.\n\nv0.15.2\n\n+ADD: Take TIM-Elements into account when totals could not be found in TimeLog Files\n\nv0.15.1\n\n+ADD: Functions to calculate the totals list of a given TimeLogs List\n-FIX: Change variable for DeviceElementId to int\n-FIX: Change variables for DDI to ushort\n\nv0.14.2.1\n\n-FIX: MultiLayer Grids were broken\n\nv0.14.2\n\n+ADD: Some functions to read the GridValue at a specific Geoposition, find out if a point is within a field and get the bounds of this field\n+ADD: Functions to Generate TimeLogs\n\nv014.1\n\n+ADD: Add an autogenerated DDIList from the isobus.net Export\n\nv0.13.3\n\n+ADD: Analysis to find DeviceElements Relevant for specific DDIs in a Task\n\nv0.13.1.1\n\n-FIX: LinkList was not marked as a file to be preserved and returned to FMIS\n\nv0.13.1\n\n+ADD: Store LinkList seperately, used e.g. in case of exporting a V3 TaskSet\n\nv0.13.0.1\n\n+ADD: Load LinkList from .XML file separately, Save LinkLink into a separate LinkList file if needed.
