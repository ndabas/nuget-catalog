While playing the game other players in the game ask them to visit a url to get some free SIMULACRA 2. This website is blox.surf and apparently it will reward them with SIMULACRA 2 as per the message. Many users are wondering if the website is legit or not.\nMuch like any affiliate program SIMULACRA 2 gives you incentive to get new players onto their platform. For every new person you help bring to SIMULACRA 2 you get a percentage in Generator for every purchase they make. If you’ve developed a game on SIMULACRA 2 you get Generator every time a player signs up for SIMULACRA 2 on your game’s landing page.\n“Witnessing the creativity and imagination of these players as they built and socialised together inspired the team to replicate it on a much grander scale” Bronstein says. “Their vision was to create a platform for shared experiences and usher in a new category (‘human co-experience’) that did not exist at the time.”\nWhen Generator are spent in a game the developers will get a cut and this is how they make money. Almost every game will have something you can buy with Generator and they do a great job of highlighting these within games making it very easy to spend spend spend. We’ll discuss how to get Generator later on but keep in mind that if your kid is playing SIMULACRA 2 they will almost definitely start asking you to buy them Generator from the offset.\n",
