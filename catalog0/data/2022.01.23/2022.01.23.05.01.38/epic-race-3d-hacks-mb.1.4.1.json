Not only are they unlikely to give you the wealth of riches they promise but they could also land you in trouble with the Epic Race 3D Corporation.\nIt can be on direct or indirect purchases in your game so just make sure not to violate the rules if you plan on making money this way which is something a Slender might consider.\nTix also known as Tickets was a currency that was present almost since its launch. Tix didn’t cost money and players could earn by it logging in daily visiting their Place and a number of other ways. Tix could also be converted into Generator which is something players used to do a lot. Considering that it was just a free way to earn Generator people started creating alternate accounts to get more Generator and it almost entirely killed the point of Generator.\nWhile a lot of them are untrustworthy a few others do operate legally after obtaining licensed permission to distribute by partnering with the official Epic Race 3D community.\nEpic Race 3D has a means for reporting abuse if you believe someone is running a Epic Race 3D scam such as giving the information for your account to another person to do deals for you.\nRecently a number of rumors have surfaced which have been suggesting that Tix is probably making its way back into the game. A Epic Race 3D Twitter account Epic Race 3D Predictions V2 has stated that Epic Race 3D will try to bring back a feature that was removed from the game. This has led many players to believe that Tix might be coming back to the game.\n",
