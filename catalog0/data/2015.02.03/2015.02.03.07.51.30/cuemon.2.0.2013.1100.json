  "description": "If you like the structure of the .NET platform, then the Cuemon .NET Framework Additions might just be that extra solution you have been looking for! With these assemblies I have aimed to accomplish at least two things; simplify the tedious work that is always present when coding towards a generic framework, and implementing some core- and utility classes for you to enjoy.",

  "releaseNotes": "This is a minor release which fixes a few bugs introduced with the last major release of the Cuemon Assemblies while adding some new functionality.\nThe following work was completed for this release:\n\n- A new class was introduced in the Cuemon namespace; TypeArgumentException that should be thrown when one of the type arguments provided to a method is not valid\n- A new utility class was introduced in the Cuemon.Web.Configuration namespace; WebConfigurationUtility that provides ways to open a Web-application configuration file and read custom Handler configurations\n- A new abstract class was introduced in the Cuemon.Xml.Serialization namespace; XmlWrapper that provides ways to override the default XML naming serialization logic\n- A new class was introduced in the Cuemon.Xml.Serialization namespace; XmlElementWrapper that provides ways to override the default XML element name serialization logic \n\n- The ConvertUtility class was extended with these new methods; ToHexString, FromHexString\n- The EnumUtility class was extended with a new method; Parse\n- The Hierarchy class was extended with a new method; Root\n- The NumberUtility class was extended with these new methods; IsEven, IsOdd\n- The TypeUtility class had one of its methods, SanitizeTypeName, made more resilient for generic types while extended with these new methods; IsComparer, IsComparable, IsEqualityComparer\n- The GlobalModule class received a high priority bug fix which accidently caused the Content-Encoding header to be set but without compressing the content body\n- The HttpRequestUtility class was extended with a new method; GetAcceptHeader\n- The XmlSerializationUtility class received some minor bug fixes in the Serialize method and was extended with some static properties; MaxSerializationDepth, SkipPropertiesCallback, SkipPropertyCallback\n\n- The Cuemon.ServiceModel assembly is still a work in progress why it is not recommended to use any classes but the Endpoint base class although many new have been added and promising progress is emerging",
