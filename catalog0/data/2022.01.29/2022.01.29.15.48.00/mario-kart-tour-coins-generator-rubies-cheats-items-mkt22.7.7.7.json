Possible Mario Kart Tour hacks may range from simple speed hacks, teleporting to item drop hacks, more rewards, challenge complete cheats and much more depending on your system OS (Android or iOS gaming system), the exact build and update of the game and other factors, such as server-side processing in single player and PvP multiplayer alike.
