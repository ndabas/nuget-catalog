  "description": "Excel-DNA eases the development of Excel add-ins using .NET. \n    Add-ins created with Excel-DNA can export high-performance user-defined functions and macros, and can be packed into a single file for easy distribution and installation.\n \n    Excel versions 97 through 2010 can be targeted with a single add-in.\n    Advanced Excel features are supported, including multi-threaded recalculation (Excel 2007 and later), registration-free RTD servers (Excel 2002 and later) and customized Ribbon and Task Pane interfaces (Excel 2007 and 2010).\n\n    Excel-DNA supports both the .NET runtime version 2.0 (which is used by .NET versions 2.0, 3.0 and 3.5) and version 4. \n\n    The Excel-Dna Runtime is free for all use, and distributed under a permissive open-source license that also allows commercial use.",
