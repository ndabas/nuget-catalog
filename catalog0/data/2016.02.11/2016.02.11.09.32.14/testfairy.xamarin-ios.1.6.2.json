  "description": "TestFairy is a powerful app testing platform which helps iOS developers send their apps to testers and provides videos that show exactly what happened on the client side during the test.\n\n    When testing mobile apps in the crowd, you never know what exactly was done and if there was a problem, what exactly went wrong on the client side. \n\n    TestFairy solves this problem by providing you a video of the exact test that was done, including CPU, Memory, GPS, Network and a lot more.",
