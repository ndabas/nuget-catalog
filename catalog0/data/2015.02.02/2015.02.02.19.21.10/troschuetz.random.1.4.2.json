  "description": "Fully managed library providing various random number generators and distributions.\n      More precisely, this library offers four generators (ALF, MT19937, Standard, XorShift128), five discrete distributions (Bernoulli, Binomial, DiscreteUniform, Geometric, Poisson) and twenty continuous distributions (like Normal, Exponential, ChiSquare, Beta, and so on); moreover, it offers a random class similar to the one Python offers (TRandom).\n      All the hard work behind this library was done by Stefan Troschütz, and for which I thank him very much. What I am doing with his great project, is simply to refactor and improve his code, while offering the new random class similar to the one Python offers.\n      You can find the modified source code and the available documentation at this address: http://goo.gl/vIV2G",

  "releaseNotes": "Starting from release 1.4.2.0, releases will come slower, since much effort will be devoted to create unit tests and improve available code.\n      Moreover, from that release you will find a GUI in the package, to \"play\" with available distributions and generators.\n      Public methods and properties should be considered stable, and there should not be any change to them; if important changes are made, they will notified here and version will accordingly change.",
