  "description": "Fully asynchronous Redis client, capable of pipelined operations; this acts as a multiplexer, allowing high-performance parallel usage of a single connection (or few connections) without being blocked on each separate request. All core redis opeations are supported. This library can also be used from C# 5.0/async very effectively.",
