  "description": "A managed library for communicating with the Android Debug Bridge.\n\n*** CONTAINS BREAKING CHANGES ***\nFixed issue with SyncService.DoPushFile failing because of the chmod. Although, it is now just checking if it can do the chmod first. Which means if it can't, instead of failing, it just wont do the chmod (workitem:20040)\nUdated the signature for the RemoveForward to not include the remotePort. I guess this changed in some later version of ADB becuase it used to take it. (workitem:21236) *** BREAKING CHANGE ***\nUpdated the regex used to get the connected devices. This will allow \"remote\" (or TCP) devices to be returned. Also added the \"-l\" flag to the call to get the devices. This returns more information about the connected devices. (workitem:21136)\nFixed the issue with the SyncService.PullFile writing the wrong number of bytes. (workitem:20831)\nFixed the date parsing issue where \"CultureInfo.CurrentCulture\" was used. This was mainly when getting the directory contents. It is now forcing \"en-US\". Until there is a case were this does not work, this is what will be used. (workitem:20458)\nAdded a unified method to execute query commands to the adb server. \nAdded method to Remove All Forwards to the AdbHelper.\nChanged the constuctor of Device to now take model, product, and device. These are information that is returned now from the AdbHelper.GetDevices since it contains the \"-l\" flag. *** BREAKING CHANGE ***",
