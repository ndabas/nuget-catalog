  "releaseNotes": "What's new?\n\n      ExportServcie:\n      - #9760 ListProducts now also supports passing in lastUpdatedFrom. This means that delta-exports now can be fetched for Products as well as for ProductItems.\n      ExportHelper in StormApiClient nuget package has been changed to support this with a new overload for ListProducts.\n\n      ProductService:\n      - #9711 New Property, UomCount on Product.\n      - #9711 New Properties, UnitOfMeasurement, UnitOfMeasurementCount and EanCode on ProductItem.\n\n      ShoppingService:  \n      - #9454 New Property, DescriptionHeader on BasketItem.\n      https://services.enferno.se/api/1.1/docs/#/Shopping/Entities/BasketItem\n\n      - #9454 New Property, TypeId on Basket. This makes it possible to distinguish baskets on Type. See documentation for available types.\n      https://services.enferno.se/api/1.1/docs/#/Shopping/Entities/Basket\n\n      - #9454 New Property, HoldFromDate on Subscription. This is to complement HoldTodate.\n      https://services.enferno.se/api/1.1/docs/#/Shopping/Entities/Subscription\n        \n      - #9711 New Property, UomCount on BasketItem.\n\n      - #9454 Changed Method, ListSubscriptions. Added parameters to enable filtering on status.\n      Although this is a breaking change it will not impact any client sites since this is new functionality not   used yet.\n        https://services.enferno.se/api/1.1/docs/#/Shopping/Operations/ListSubscriptions\n        \n      - #9783 New Method, UpdateBasket2. Replaces UpdateBasket (Depricated) since UpdateBasket had some side effects on customer data which was not intended. UpdateBasket2 updates basket data excluding any customer data. To change customer data on a Basket use UpdateBuyer/UpdatePayer/UpdateShipTo.\n        https://services.enferno.se/api/1.1/docs/#/Shopping/Operations/UpdateBasket2\n\n      - #9454 New Method, GetSubscriptionByBasket. Get a Subscription by basketId. Can be used when subscriptionId is not known but basket id is. Basket must probably be fetched first and the if Basket.TypeId = 3 (Subscription), then a GetSubscriptionByBasket can be used.\n        https://services.enferno.se/api/1.1/docs/#/Shopping/Operations/UpdateBasket2\n       \n       \n      What's fixed?\n\n      ProductService:\n      - #8833 GetProductOnHandBy[PartNo|Product] now takes default warehouse if none is supplied. Now also considering pricelist connections to warehouses.\n      - #8833 GetExternalProductOnHandBy[PartNo|Product] now takes default warehouse if none is supplied. Now also considering pricelist connections to warehouses.\n      - #9623 Fixed problem when returning same OnHand value as passed in instead of actual value.\n\n      ShoppingService:\n      - #9314, #9342 ShipTo Customer data such as name, phone and email was not saved correctly and defaulted to the Buyer's data. This has now been fixed in the API but still needs changes in the order workflow and StormAdmin. This also applies to KlarnaCheckout when payments have been accepted. Impact is in all methods handling customer data on Basket.\n      - #8833 ListProductOnHandByBasket now takes default warehouse if none is supplied. Now also considering pricelist connections to warehouses.\n      - #8833 ListExternalProductOnHandByBasket now takes default warehouse if none is supplied. Now also considering pricelist connections to warehouses.\n\n      Promotions:\n      #9622: UsageCount on Promotions with discount codes and usage limit was not working correctly. This has now been fixed.\n        \n       \n      Miscellaneous changes? \n\n      ShoppingService:\n      - Internal code improvements in almost all methods in ShoppingService. Added more reuse of cached products when populating BasketItems. This impacts all methods that change BasketItems.\n       \n      General:\n      - Improvements in the documentation.\n      -#9810 Reduced cache time for the API to 5 minutes. This is a test and if performance is not affected we will keep this setting. Otherwise we will return to previous settings for the cache.\n       \n\n      Feedback?\n      Faults and strange behavior can be reported to support@enferno.se or to patrik.rosquist@enferno.se.\n       \n       \n      Regards,\n      The Storm API Team",
