  "description": "Xamarin Forms is great for developing apps on Android and iOS but it is missing some important features: \n•Scalable images\n•PCL and Shared Library, multi-screen / multi-resolution image management\n•HTML formatted text for labels and buttons\n•PCL and Shared Library custom font management\n\nAndroid developers can use NinePatch bitmaps, the drawable directory naming convention, Html.FromHtml, and a bunch of complex file manipulations to address the image issue.  Likewise, iOS developers can use ResizeableImageWithCapInsets, the @2x, @3x, @4x file naming convention, and some 3rd party libraries for this purpose.  Forms 9 Patch enhances Xamarin Forms to make multi-resolution / multi-screen image management, custom fonts, and HTML text formatting easy for PCL apps for iOS and Android.",
