  "description": "UrhoSharp is a lightweight Game Engine suitable for using with C# and F# to create games that run on Android, iOS, Mac, Windows and Unix. The game engine is available as a portable class library, allowing your game code to be written once and shared across all platforms. UrhoSharp is powered by Urho3D (http://urho3d.github.io/), a game engine that has been under development for more than a decade.   All the samples from Urho3D have been ported to C# to help you get started:\n\nhttps://github.com/xamarin/urho-samples\n\nAmong the features of the Urho3D you will find:\n\n\n•\tDirect3D9, Direct3D11, OpenGL 2.0 or 3.2 or OpenGL ES 2.0 rendering\n•\tHLSL or GLSL shaders + caching of HLSL bytecode\n•\tConfigurable rendering pipeline. Default implementations for forward, light pre-pass and deferred rendering\n•\tComponent based scene model\n•\tSkeletal (with hardware skinning), vertex morph and node animation\n•\tAutomatic instancing on SM3 capable hardware\n•\tPoint, spot and directional lights\n•\tShadow mapping for all light types; cascaded shadow maps for directional lights\n•\tParticle rendering\n•\tGeomipmapped terrain\n•\tStatic and skinned decals\n•\tAuxiliary view rendering (reflections etc.)\n•\tGeometry, material & animation LOD\n•\tSoftware rasterized occlusion culling\n•\tPost-processing\n•\tHDR renderingv1.31\n•\t2D sprites and particles that integrate into the 3D scenev1.31\n•\tTask-based multithreading\n•\tHierarchical performance profiler\n•\tScene and object load/save in binary and XML format\n•\tKeyframe animation of object attributes\n•\tBackground loading of resources\n•\tKeyboard, mouse, joystick and touch input (if available)\n•\tPhysics using Bullet\n•\t2D physics using Box2D\n•\tNetworking using kNet + possibility to make HTTP requests\n•\tPathfinding and crowd simulation using Recast/Detour\n•\tImage loading using stb_image + DDS / KTX / PVR compressed texture support\n•\t2D and “3D” audio playback, Ogg Vorbis support using stb_vorbis + WAV format support\n•\tTrueType font rendering using FreeType, AngelCode bitmap fonts are also supported\n•\tUnicode string support\n•\tInbuilt UI system\n•\tScene editor and UI-layout editor implemented in script with undo & redo capabilities\n•\tModel/scene/animation/material import from formats supported by Open Asset Import Library\n•\tAlternative model/animation import from OGRE mesh.xml and skeleton.xml files",
