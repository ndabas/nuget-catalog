  "releaseNotes": "- Added support for Copy/Move/Rename commands\n - Added support for Invoke-Item, Set-ItemProperty, Clear-ItemProperty, and Clear-Item\n - Added an ItemNavigator base class to make it easier to support a recursive hierarchy of objects\n - Added support for customizing the PSDriveInfo via the NewDrive method on the IMountAnythingProvider\n - Added support for specifying a Root value when mounting a PSDrive\n - Cleaned up the results of Get-ItemProperty\n - Added a way to register services in the container via the more familiar `IServiceCollection` api. Autofac is still used behind the scenes due to its ability to have custom registrations in a nested lifetime scope.\n\nBREAKING CHANGES:\n\n - The IContentReaderHandler and IContentWriterHandler interfaces have been changed to be Stream based to simplify their typical implementation.\n - Changed the default behavior of the Item base so that its TypeName is based on its class name instead of the UnderlyingObject's type.\n - Updated NewItem method of the INewItemHandler to return the item that is created\n - Renamed the RegisterServices to ConfigureContainer to match the ASP.NET Core naming scheme (in Startup)",
