  "releaseNotes": "Improvements\n\n* Improved the naming of MVC transactions.  Naming to controller/action should be much more reliable now.\n* Improved WebAPI support.  You should now see Web Transactions grouped by [controller].[action] rather than all WebAPI transactions reporting as System.Web.Http.WebHost.HttpControllerHandler.\n* Fixed a bug whereby IIS applications with underscore characters in their names were not displayed correctly in the Status Monitor.\n* Fixed a bug whereby users could not view the log file for some IIS applications in the Status Monitor.",
