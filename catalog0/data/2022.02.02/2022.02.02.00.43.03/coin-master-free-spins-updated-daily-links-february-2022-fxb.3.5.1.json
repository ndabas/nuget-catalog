Youâ€™ve come to the right place. This is an addictive mobile game by design. It combines the thrill of playing slots with the social battling of Clash of Clans to create something that you just canâ€™t put down; in a good way. The problem is, you so often have to put it down if youâ€™re not willing to fork out the cash for regular spins. Thatâ€™s understandable when as little as 30 spins will set you back Â£1.99 in the UK or $1.99 in the US.\n\nFortunately for you though, there are a wide number of means of getting Coin Master free spins, reducing the need for you to spend and increasing the speed at which you can progress throughout this addictive experience. Many of them are easy to pull off too, so you donâ€™t have to worry about going through complicated maneuvres to carry on playing your favourite game.\n\nIn this guide, weâ€™re going to provide you with all of the ways you can get your hands on a few free spins here and there. This will allow you to continue playing long after your daily free spins run out, and provide you with the means of getting extra, without the need to spend your hard-earned money on premium spins in the gameâ€™s store. Weâ€™d also recommend checking out our Coin Master free cards and Coin Master free coins guides to get even more rewards, and our Pet Master free spins guide if you fancy checking out Moon Activeâ€™s latest game.",
