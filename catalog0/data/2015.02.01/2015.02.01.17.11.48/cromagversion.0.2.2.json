  "description": "An MSBuild project integration that makes it easy to keep version numbers synced across all projects in a solution based on a simple date scheme and user provided major / minor version numbers.  Provides a single source of truth for versioning, and modifies it at build time as necessary to keep assembly metadata fresh.",
