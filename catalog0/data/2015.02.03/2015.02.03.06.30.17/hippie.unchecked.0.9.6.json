  "description": "DISCLAIMER: This is an \"unchecked\" version of the Hippie library, that is, it is a release where all integrity checks have been stripped away to achieve the best performance. Use this instead of the original Hippie library IF AND ONLY IF you are certain that your code does not rely on those integrity checks and that it never violates them.\n      Fully managed library providing five types of heap. It implements d-ary, binary, binomial, fibonacci and pairing heaps, in order to let the user choose the best heap to fit her needs. Each heap has its own advantages and disadvantages: please see the documentation or Wikipedia to better understand how those data structures work and how they behave in each operation.",

However, library is now stable and next releases will bring only bug fixes (if necessary) and new documentation.\n      * Most important changes are related to raw heaps, whose behaviour has been changed to allow a safer usage.",
