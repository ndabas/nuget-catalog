  "description": "This library is collection of code that I have used in several unrelated projects, games, web sites, assemblers,\n\t\tcompilers etc. Therefore, there is no real roadmap for this library. I add code when I find something that I have\n\t\tused on multiple projects or when I develop something new that I am most likely to use in multiple projects. \n\t\tSuggestions are welcome! Do however understand that this is not by any means my primary project.\n\n\t\tAt this point, the most dominant feature would be the BBCode part of the library. In time, it might be something \n\t\telse. In short, here is some code that is bothersome to build from scratch but is freely available.",
