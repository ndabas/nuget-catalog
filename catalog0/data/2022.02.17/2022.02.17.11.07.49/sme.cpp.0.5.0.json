  "releaseNotes": "New in version 0.5.0 since 0.4.4\n*****************\n* Major changes *\n*****************\n- The decompiler backend (ICSharpCode) has been replaced by a compiler backend\n(Microsoft Codeanalysis).\n- Upgraded to support .NET 5\n***********\n* Changes *\n***********\n- VHDL keyword avoidance prefix was incorrectly added to bus signal names in\nthe trace file. They already carried a prefix from the bus name.\n- Moved from Travis to Github Actions.\n- Added support for supplying custom renderers to processes.\n- Added preliminary support for floating point data types. They can be used on\nbuses and initialization values. The generated VHDL inside of the processes\nare still incorrect, however.\n- Added \"generate\" as a VHDL keyword.\n- Added the clog2 function to the generated VHDL.\n- Processes, which uses arrays, are now parameterized in the generated VHDL,\ninstead of being hardcoded.\n- NuGet packages have been updated.\n- Added \"next\" and \"constant\" VHDL keywords.\n- Added optional code coverage during testing.\n- Unit testing has increased to improve coverage.\n*********\n* Fixes *\n*********\n- Omitted type definitions when buses have multiple fields of IFixedArray type.\n- Buses would sometimes carry U values, when it should have been the default\nvalue, in the trace file.\n- Naming of the top-level scope now matches the assembly namespace, not the\nnamespace of the first created process.\n- Some processes were incorrectly named.\n- Array lengths was sometimes placed incorrectly.\n- Multiple type definitions were generated.\n- Multiple type conversions on signals were generated.\n- Dual port memory is now correctly reset.\n- Missing type conversions in function invocations.\n- Some loop edges were incorrectly transformed for irregular loop edges.\n- Missing sizes on constant arrays.\n- Missing initial value in dependency cycle test.\n- Internal arrays in memory components shouldn't be readonly.\n- Incorrect warning about comparing symbols.\n- Updated RAMs to be generic.\n- ColorBin example wasn't properly checked.\n- Increased the size of the ColorBin, AES, NoiseFilter, ExternalComponent,\nSimpleMIPS, and StopWatch tests longer.\n- Enum definitions wouldn't compile.\n- Found incorrect string comparisons when launching programs.\n- Type wasn't loaded properly for parameters.\n- Found a race condition in the code for buses, which lead to an improper\nmodeling of multiple processes writing to the same bus signal. This is still\nnot properly captured, so multiple processes running in parallel can write to\nthe same signal, which is not allowed in actual hardware. Current solution\nsuggestion is to introduce a warning, since the bus cannot know which process\nwrote what.",
