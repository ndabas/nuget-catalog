  "description": "Vault for Umbraco is an easy-to-use, extensible ORM to quickly and easily get strongly-typed Umbraco CMS data into your views. It allows you to create lightly-decorated classes that Vault will understand how to hydrate. This gives you the full view model-style experience in Umbraco that you are accustomed to in MVC, complete with strongly-typed view properties (no more magic strings in your views).",

  "releaseNotes": "**New Feature: Lazy Loading**\n\n          Umbraco Vault now includes support for lazy loading of properties. Properties that are expensive to hydrate,\n          such as collections, can be marked as `virtual` and they will be loaded when accessed. See https://github.com/thenerdery/UmbracoVault/wiki/Lazy-property-loading\n          article for more detail on this feature.\n\n          **New Type Handlers**\n\n            * Vault now supports nullable types for primitives and structs. See https://github.com/thenerdery/UmbracoVault/wiki/Umbraco-Data-Type---C%23-Data-Type-Grid#nullable-data-types for more detail.\n            * Vault now supports mapping from JSON data stored within properties. See https://github.com/thenerdery/UmbracoVault/wiki/Umbraco-Data-Type---C%23-Data-Type-Grid#json-data for more detail.\n\n          **Issues**\n\n            * Fixed issue where exception would be thrown if loading an assembly threw an error. Added try/catch around logic and tracing any issues identified.\n            * Fixed issue if an external assembly attempts to register a type already handled, that an exception would be thrown. A trace warning is now written instead.\n\n          **Other**\n\n            * Codebase has been updated to build against VS 2015 and C# 6\n            * Reference sites for testing builds have been updated to the latest v6 and v7 versions, including ASP.Net MVC5\n            * Various code cleanup\n\n            This is a pretty significant release! Thanks to @NerderyMGlanzer, @technicallyerik, and @jesse-black for their contributions!",
