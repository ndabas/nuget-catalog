  "description": "Adds official StyleCop MSBuild targets to your project. Runs StyleCop analysis on your project with every build. Works both on a developer workstation (with or without Visual Studio) and on a build server. Includes official StyleCop binaries. Does not require installation of StyleCop on either a developer workstation or build server. For update notifications follow https://twitter.com/#!/adamralph and/or subscribe to http://adamralph.blogspot.com/. Come and chat to fellow developers about StyleCop and StyleCop.MSBuild at https://jabbr.net/#/rooms/stylecop/.\n\nNOTE: There is a known issue with NuGet Package Manager 1.8 or later. If you have problems installing this version of StyleCop.MSBuild, see http://nuget.codeplex.com/workitem/2253 for a workaround.\n\nNOTE: If your solution is currently using StyleCop.MSBuild.4.7.17.0 or earlier, updating to this version will NOT work. Instead, uninstall your current version and then install this version.",
