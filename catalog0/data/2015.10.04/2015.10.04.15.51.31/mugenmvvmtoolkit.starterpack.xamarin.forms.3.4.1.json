You can also easily add a new kind of navigation.\n      - Navigation system works with view models and allows to expect the completion of the operation. You can pass any parameters between view models.\n      - Good design mode support, for xaml platforms supports the creation of design view model with any constructor parameters.\n      - Supports bindings on all platforms, all of the native binding features available for WPF platform available on all platforms and even more.\n      - Binding supports C# language expressions like Linq, Extension methods, method call, ternary operator (?:), coalescing operator (??), etc.\n      - Supports subscription to any control event.\n      - Built-in support for validation.\n      - You can easily write their own extensions for bindings.\n      - Supports attached members (properties, events, methods), you can extend any object as you want.\n      - Special editor for WinForms, you do not need to write code to create bindings.\n      - Binding parser builds syntax tree that allows you to easily change or extend the bindings, without manipulation of the raw text.\n      - Binding supports fluent syntax.\n      - Excellent binding performance.",
