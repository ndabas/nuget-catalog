Open the actual program, ‘pokemongo-webspoof’ and it should open the app along with Xcode. Just some quick notes, make sure you have all three buttons selected in the spoofing program to “update Xcode location” and all that. I know that most of the Pokemon Go players are already familiar with these warnings and bans, and probably some of them have already",
