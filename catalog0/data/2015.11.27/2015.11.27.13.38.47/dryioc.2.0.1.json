  "releaseNotes": "v2.0.1\n          - fixed: #200 Multiple instances for Singleton created when Container is shared among multiple threads\n\n          v2.0.0\n          - Support for PCL 328 and 259 profiles, and .NET Core via dotnet moniker.\n          - More consistent and complete API surface.\n          - Diagnostics of potential resolution problems with `container.VerifyResolutions()`.\n          - Improved registration and first resolution time.\n          - Support of really large object graphs.\n          - Possibility of compile-time factory delegate generation. Utilized by DryIocZero.\n          - Ambient current scope and `Reuse.InWebRequest` for ASP.NET integration.\n          - Support for static and instance factory methods in addition to constructor, including support for method parameters injection.\n          - Powerful open-generics support including variance, constraints, open-generic factory methods in open-generic classes.\n          - Service key of arbitrary type. The only requirement for key type is to implement `GetHashCode` and `Equals`.\n          - Resolve as `KeyValuePair` to get service key with service object.\n          - Register with condition for resolution.\n          - Required service type support: e.g. `var serviceObjects = c.Resolve{object[]}(typeof(Service));`.\n          - Optional parameters support.\n          - Fine-grained control over injection of parameters, properties, and fields.\n          - Injection of primitive values.\n          - Control how reused service is stored and disposed via `weaklyReferenced` and `preventDisposal` setups.\n          - Resolve service collection as `IList{T}`, `ICollection{T}`, `IReadOnlyList{T}`, `IReadOnlyCollection{T}`.\n          - Register once, existing registration update, unregister.\n          - removed: Compilation to DynamicAssembly. DryIoc is fast enough without its complexity.",
