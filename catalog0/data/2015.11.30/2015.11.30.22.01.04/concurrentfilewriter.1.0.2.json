  "description": "A class library for managing multi-threaded sequential write access to one or more files.\nIt is capable of flushing writes from multiple threads in batches by either hitting a specified size threshold or a specified inactivity time limit. It is also possible to write this batching information within the output file(s).\nNote: This class should be injected as a single or static instance shared across all process threads.\nFiles will be locked exclusively from the first Write() call until FlushAndClose() or Dispose() is called (presently one of these *must* be explicitly called to ensure all data is flushed).\n\nThe ConcurrentFileWriter class can be found as an extension of System.IO\n\n*** Full debugging source/symbols are available from http://srv.symbolsource.org/pdb/Public\n\nUsage Example:\n\nvar cfw = new ConcurrentFileWriter(new ConcurrentFileWriterSettings {\n             flushTimeInMilliseconds = 5000,\n             flushSizeInBytes = 10000,\n             showWriteBatchingMarkers = true\n                });\n\n//Pre-lock file (not required)\ncfw.Write(@\"c:\\temp\\test.log\", null);\n\n//Append a string (byte arrays can also be directly written)\ncfw.WriteUtf8Line(@\"c:\\temp\\test.log\", \"Test Line\");\n\n//Flush and unlock specified file (stop managing)\ncfw.CloseManagedFile(@\"c:\\temp\\test.log\");\n\n//Flush and unlock all managed files\ncfw.Dispose();",
