  "description": "If you like the structure of the .NET platform, then the Cuemon .NET Framework Additions might just be that extra solution you have been looking for! With these assemblies I have aimed to accomplish at least two things; simplify the tedious work that is always present when coding towards a generic framework, and implementing some core- and utility classes for you to enjoy.",

  "releaseNotes": "Focusing on the Cuemon.Web assembly, several improvements (while refactoring and streamlining) has been implemented.\n\nFirst - and foremost - the GlobalModule has been revamped for easier usage by the implementor; easy adoption to comression, caching expires headers (static and dynamic) and last but not least - HTML related content parsing for guranteed forced refresh of cached content.\n\nFurther, one of my more \"hidden\" away method has been made generic and static and implemented on the HttpResponseUtility class; SetClientCacheExpiresHeaders.\n\nLast but not least, the WebsiteModule (inheriting from GlobalModule) has been updated accordingly to the revamped GlobalModule. This means, that the special performance tweaks i found necessary on the cuemon.net website now ports directly to the new and improved GlobalModule.\n\nEnjoy.",
