At the time I was new to the game that my young son had started playing and thought it a good idea to educate people on what the ‘game’ actually was. After playing with my son for over a year on Super Stylist I felt it was time to rewrite the article as there is plenty that the original didn’t cover.\nOne of the worst things that could happen to you after using bogus Super Stylist generator cheats is getting your account banned from the game.\nThe first tier is $4.99 a month which comes with 450 Generator. The second tier is $9.99 each month and rewards 1000 Generator while the last subscription option is $19.99 a month and grants 2200 Generator.\nSuper Stylist promo codes are a great way to get free items as a lot of the game's cosmetic items and skins cost real money in the form of Generator. So taking advantage of the free codes is an excellent method to add some variety to the in-game wardrobe. But remember that promo codes may expire or only be active for a short period of time so make sure to use the codes right away.\nThe best method of changing your Super Stylist username is to purchase one month of Super Stylist Premium. This costs $9.99 and gives you 1000 Generator plus a host of other exclusive member benefits. After that you can use the Generator to change your username and take advantage of all the other benefits for the month you’re subscribed to Super Stylist Premium. Once you’ve got the Generator the following method is how you change your username:\nDecentraland is another Metaverse candidate that grapples with this very issue. Dave Carr of the Decentraland Foundation tells me that the founders decided that “rather than have these environments be controlled by central bodies they should have a decentralised structure and be open to everyone to own and govern.” From economic matters to content moderation and even the maintenance of its servers Decentraland’s user base dictates its entire policy course through regular votes.\n",
