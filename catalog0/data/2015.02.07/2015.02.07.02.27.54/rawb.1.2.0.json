  "description": "This is a collection of high-performance web UI controls for use with Knockout: grids, scrollbars, \"draggers\", splitters, etc.  I've given up on finding decent controls, so I've written my own.  These were designed for Knockout from the ground up, they try to provide mechanism rather than policy, and they are intended to be simple and composable.",
