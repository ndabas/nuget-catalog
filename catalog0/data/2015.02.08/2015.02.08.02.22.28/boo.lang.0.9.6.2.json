  "releaseNotes": "booish: describe() now looks for XML documentation of referenced assemblies.\n    booish: Autocompletion offers suggestions in a scrollable list with one offer per row (better overview).\n    booish: Solved some problems with managing input into the shell. Added mode to allow users to paste content into the shell.\n    booish: booish.rsp now offers additional options to configure the startup behaviour of the shell.\n    booish: Added means to add commands to the shell. Added booish.mod.os to demonstrate this. This module provides commands like \"cd\" and \"dir\".\n    boo: Fix of issue BOO-1078 \"Cannot use enumerations as attribute parameters.\" Version information on assemblies is now pasted into the native resources. Thus, Windows Explorer can read and display it.\n    boo: range(-1) now is an empty enumeration (instead of raising an exception).\n    boo: Operator \"isa\" now also works with structs. This is important to avoid exceptions on casts.\n    boo: Constructors and destructors now do not require a \"def\" (but you still can write this). Keyword \"def\" is redundant here (not very wrist friendly).\n    boo: Macro \"property\" now also works for static classes.\n    boo: Added macro \"getproperty\" that keeps the setter private.\n    boo: array(int, null) now returns null (without an exception). This spares some if-then when using array for casting.\n    boo: Resolved issues #57 and #58.",
