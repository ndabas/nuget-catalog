Can now include off DAOs that are on projected anonymous types.\n- Added base non-generic DataAccessObject class.\n- Added ObjectAlreadyExistsException for more specific UniqueConstraintException cases.\n- OrderBy and GroupBy now support properties that are are defined on related objects (joins are made automatically/implicitly)\n- Better unified cross-provider exceptions for failed unique constraints and when setting related objects that are missing or undefined objects\n- Fixed implicit join in Where lost when a Select follow.\n- Sqlite provider now converts composite primary keys with more than one auto-increment to a single primary key with a unique constraint across all the composites.\n- DataAccessObjects now has GetReference\n- DataAccessObjects GetByPrimaryKey and GetManyByPrimaryKey now support composite and complex primary keys\n- Support for Include() inside select and on IQueryable.\n- Support for Include() when selecting related objects on objects.\n- Improved composite GetByPrimaryKey support in DataAccessObjects collections.\n- Support recursive Include()\n- Support implicit (recursive) joins when predicating or selecting on related objects\n- Composite primary keys made up of objects are now supported.\n- Improved performance\n- Fixed non-aggregate  count.
