Granted, you also can‚Äôt redeem gift cards, which is likely a bummer for anyone who received them as presents this morning. That‚Äôs likely a ton of people, huh? A lot of people who are surely loading and re-loading hoping that something has changed this time...oh, this will probably be a while.\n\nOriginal Final Fantasy VII Looks Gorgeous At 60FPS\nTwitch Star Ninja Threatens Pokimane With Legal Action For Alleged 'Harassment'\nNetflix's Cuphead Trailer Is Slightly E",
