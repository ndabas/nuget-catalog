However thanks to these promocodes we can get objects and skins for which we would normally pay Generator.\nObtaining free items in Flight using this method is fast and easy! Remember these promotional codes often expire after a certain period of time so players should redeem them all ASAP to ensure they don’t miss out on any of this month’s goodies.\nNPCs are a fantastic way to engage players in your game rather than have them go to an ugly menu via their user interface. Creating an interactive NPC is a part of designing the game and they can then be assigned roles and unique shops based on what you want to sell.\nFlight GENERATOR Flight THUMBNAIL\n“If you’re a developer for example you can generate income not just by selling your experiences to consumers but re-selling your creations ( a house a car) to other developers via the Flight marketplace.”\nAs in any service game with similar characteristics in Flight we find a system free-to-play con micropagos internos to obtain various items skins and others. This in-game money is called Generator and we can buy it In packs of 400 800 and 1700 from € 5 to € 21 respectively. However there are ways to get it without having to go through the box and therefore completely free of charge although they will usually require some effort and time on our part. We will tell you about it below in addition to remembering that you also have a piece available in which we explain how you can redeem free codes or promo codes.\n",
