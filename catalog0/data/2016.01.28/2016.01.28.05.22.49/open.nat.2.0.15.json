  "releaseNotes": "**Version 2.0.11**\n      Allows the creation of mappings with arbitrary Private IP address.\n      Fixes defect #22. \n        - Routers failed with 404 when service control url had a question mark (?) \n        - DD-WRT Linux base router (and others probably) fails with 402-InvalidArgument when index is out of range. \n        - Some routers retuns invalid mapping entries with empty internal client.\n\n      Fixes defect #24.\n      GetSpecificMappingEntry fails with 402-InvalidArgument in DD-WRT Linux base router when mapping is not found.\n\n      **Version 2.0.10**\n      Fixes defect #20. Absolute service control URL path and query miscalculated.   \n      \n      **Version 2.0.9**\n      Fixes defects #16. Parameterless DiscoverDeviceAsync method throws exception\n\n      **Version 2.0.8**\n      Fixes several defects. #10, #11, #12, #13 and #14\n\n      **2.0.0**\n      Thus version breaks backward compatibility with v1.\n      Changes the event-based discovery process' nature to an asynchronous one.\n\n      **1.1.0**\n      Fix for SSDP Location header.\n      After this version Open.NAT breaks backward compatibility.\n\n      **1.0.19**\n      Minor changes previous to v2.\n\n      **1.0.18**\n      Discovery timeout raises an event.\n      Permanent mappings are created when NAT only supports that kind of mappings.\n      Protocol to use in discovery process can be specified.\n      Automatic renew port mappings before expiration.\n      Add operations timeout after 4 seconds.\n      Add parameters validation in Mapping class.\n      Fix UnhandledException event was never raised.\n\n      **1.0.17**\n      Discovery timeout added.\n      Auto release ports opened in the session.\n      Fix NextSearch to use UtcNow (also performance)\n      Fix LocalIP property after add a port.\n      Tracing improvements",
