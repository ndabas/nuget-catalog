  "description": "RAID: Shadow Legends Codes to redeem 2022\n\nCLICK HERE >>> https://gamecodeclaim.com/c/rsl/\n\nCLICK HERE >>> https://gamecodeclaim.com/c/rsl/\n\nAs much as we love redeem codes and the free rewards we get from them whenever a new one is released, sometimes redeem codes can be quite... the bait. I have always found the redeem code system super useful, especially if the codes give out rewards that help players who are just starting out - but when there is a fake belief that a game has such codes, it could be quite a dealbreaker.\n\nIn RAID: Shadow Legends, redeem codes have been a topic of debate for quite a while now, and if you wanted to know whether or not the game actually has such a function, I'm here to shed some light on the matter.\n\nTake a look at our RAID Shadow Legends tier list of best champions!\nEver since its release back in the summer of 2018, RAID: Shadow Legends has been a super popular game among RPG lovers. With tons of team formations and unique, powerful hero combinations, players can have fun in so many ways! Another good part is that lately, a promo code option became available as well, and that's exactly what we will talk about below.\n\nDoes RAID: Shadow Legends have codes?\nThe short answer to this would be yes, there are RAID: Shadow Legends promo codes. The more complex answer is that there might be plenty of made-up codes, but only a very limited number of them work. Furthermore, if you happen to enter a non-existing code and you get the \"invalid code\" prompt, that could be an issue if done repeatedly.\nBut we'll cover that in more detail in a bit, so if you're interested in some RAID: Shadow Legends promo codes, let's check these out first!\n\nIf you want to get stronger in the game, you should just farm a lot of levels, be consistent in your play (login every day, farm and upgrade heroes non-stop and do all of your daily dungeons) and you'll slowly climb up the power ladder. Of course, it helps quite a lot if you decide to spend some",
