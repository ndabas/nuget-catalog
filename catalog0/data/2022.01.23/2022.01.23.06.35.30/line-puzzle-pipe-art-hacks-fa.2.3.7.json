Here you can trade the Cyclops Eyeball with Oz for 20 gems.\nYou’ve finally given in and decided to buy your kid some Generator but where do you buy them There are a few options here and I wouldn’t try any other way. There are lots of scams out there (more on this later) claiming to be giving away Generator for free ignore these and follow the different methods below.\nThere are also lots of game-specific scams out there especially in the bigger games such as Adopt Me. All of the major games do their best to combat scammers but the key thing to learn here is that if something seems too good to be true then it probably is and should be avoided.
