  "description": "With Broadcast, a single object can communicate with multiple objects in a non-generic manor, without knowing that the objects exist. The implementations within .NET such as the IObserver and IObservable pattern are a very cumbersome subscription model for method invocation. The solution .NET provides is not very elegant and forces your application to be tightly bound to the objects. Broadcast aims to decouple objects, providing an easier path for developers to make their application more maintainable.",
