  "releaseNotes": "2.0.2\n        \n- Fixed a bug that prevented combos from unregistering, and updated the docs for how to unregister properly. Thanks to pelly and g00fy-. Issue # 34.\n- Added AMD support. Issue #37.\n        \n2.0.1\n\n- Fixed a big ole bug with meta/cmd combos. Thanks to lexey111. Issue #29.\n- Fixed a bug with the Windows key being released on Windows systems. Issue #27.\n\n2.0.0\n\n-Keypress now has a listener class that must be instantiated. The functions that were previously in the global window.keypress object are now public methods of the window.keypress.Listener class.\n- Each instance of a Keypress listener can be bound to a DOM element by passing in the element to the listener's constructor.\n-Combos now default to being ordered (the property is now called is_unordered and is false by default).\n- Combos' handlers preventDefault unless the handler returns true.\n- The \"combo\" public method is now called \"simple_combo\".\n- The basic combo helpers for simple, counting and sequence combos no longer have a third prevent_default optional parameter.\n- Debugging console logs can be enabled by setting keypress.debug to true.\n- All key event callbacks send a third argument specifying whether the event is firing again automatically because the key has remained pressed down.",
