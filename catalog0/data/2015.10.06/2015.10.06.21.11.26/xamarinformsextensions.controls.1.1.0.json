  "description": "These custom controls make it faster and easier to create great apps using Xamarin.Forms.\n            The controls currently included are:\n            \n            SimpleList: For small lists, the UI of the built-in ListView leaves a lot to be desired.  You can use a StackLayout, but then you lose the ability to have an ItemTemplate and ItemSelectedCommand.\n                        That's what SimpleList was made for - it gives you the UI control of the StackLayout with the functionality of a ListView.\n                        SimpleList is not nearly as performant as ListView, so please don't use it for large lists of data!\n            GestureView (beta): The gesture view control allows you to receive all those great native gestures like swipes, pinches, etc.  The control is currently in beta due to an issue with gestures\n                                not bubbling up properly in Android when using an absolute layout container.  A bug has been filed with Xamarin, so hopefully that will be resolved soon and I'll get this\n                                into a full release.\n            ZoomImage:  Pinch and zoom photos as well as double tap to zoom.  Control allows you to enable / disable scrolling, zooming, and control the scaling amounts.  As easy to use as the native\n                        image view with even more capabilities!",
