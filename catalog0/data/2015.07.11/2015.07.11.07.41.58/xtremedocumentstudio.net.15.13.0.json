  "description": "Gnostice XtremeDocumentStudio .NET is the next-generation multi-format document-processing component suite for .NET developers. Currently, it supports viewing, printing, and converting PDF, DOCX, DOC, BMP, JPEG, PNG, WMF, EMF, TIFF and MTIFF. More formats will be introduced in future. XtremeDocumentStudio includes multi-format document viewer controls for WinForms, WebForms, MVC, WPF, and HTML5. It can also convert document from one format to another, such as DOCX-to-PDF or PDF to images without requiring any other external software or libraries. It can also intelligently reconstruct page elements when converting PDF to DOCX. Some features such as programmatic document-creation, document-editing, and mail-merge have been introduced as a preview or beta.\n\nXtremeDocumentStudio .NET is 100% managed code. It can natively process supported formats without requiring external software such as Microsoft Word, Open XML SDK, Word Automation Services, Adobe PDF library or GhostScript.",

This helps to preserve the encoder settings made on a specific format.\n    * example usage: var pdfEncoderSettings = DocumentConverter1.EncoderSettings[“PDF”];\n  - Signature of ConvertToFile and ConvertToStream is altered by interchanging the positions of ConverterSettings and EncoderSettings parameters. EncoderSettings is placed before the ConverterSettinsg as the former parameter is used most often compared to the later. \n+ Multi-Format Document Viewer\n  - WinForms and WPF\n    * Improved rendering quality\nFixed\n~~~~~\n+ DOCX\n  - Random lines were drawn when run border was set, but the border width was zero\n  - Current page number field was not displaying value in some cases\n+ PDF \n  - InvalidCastException encountered while loading documents that contain OCGs entry (in OCProperties dictionary of Catalog dictionary) for which the type of the value is IndirectReference.",
