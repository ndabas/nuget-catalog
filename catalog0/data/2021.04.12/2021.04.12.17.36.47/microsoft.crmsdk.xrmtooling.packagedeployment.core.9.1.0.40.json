  "releaseNotes": "This package contains assemblies for Dynamics 365 (online and on-premises). These assemblies require application development using the Microsoft .NET Framework 4.6.2 or later.\n     \n9.1.0.40:\nFixed a bug in runtime settings parsing that would mis identify a = in the value as a key value separator.\n\n9.1.0.39:\nFixed an issue where data import could hang without error\n\n9.1.0.37:\n  Fix for an issue where importing business units that included a lookup for their own team (looped back to the entity) would not be populated on update.\n  Fixed a general issue were related LookUp ID's that were discovered in the target system were not properly linked.\n  Behavior Change: when using BatchMode, Create will always include the ID of the record from the source system, even if not explicitly included as a field in the exported system.\n\n9.1.0.36:\nFix for an issue reported where related objects were not being correctly identified by name and thus not correctly linked to importing records\nThis only impacted imports where the related entity did not have comparison keys\n\n9.0.1.33:\nAltering the default client engine to move coreobjects to a non static type,\nStaging for merger of MTPD code with mainline PD. \nAdded in memory configuration parsing logic\nOptimized dependency checking logic\n\n9.1.0.27:\nCleaned up extra lines in logging output.\nAdding Logging for time taken during configuraiton parsing to aid in performance info.\nUptook New CDS SDK drop.\n\n9.1.0.24:\nFixed an issue preventing logs from being generated correctly,  Logs should once again write to the log directory\n\n9.1.0.21:\nMany Logging improvements\nFixed an issue with Async Solution Import. \nIncludes fixes from DMT: Fixed bug with preprocessing that would cause an apparent runaway, removed check for display name on attributes, updated batch mode system. \n\n9.1.0.20:\nIntroduced binding redirect for Microsoft.IdentityModel.Clients.ActiveDirectory dll.\nPackage developers can define error type as application error or publisher error - internal only.\n\n9.0.2.30:\nEnhanced PD logs and temporary file delete logic.\n\n9.0.2.29:\nEnhanced PD logs and raise fail event immediately when AfterPackageImport returns fail.\n\n9.0.2.26:\nEnhanced PD to pass more error details to invoker of PD lib\n\n9.0.2.24:\nPublished PackaDeployerException class which can be used by package developers\nEnhanced PD to bubble up error details to invoker of PD lib with progress status in case of failure - internal only\n\n9.0.2.23: \nInternal updates - No Public changes \n\n9.0.2.22: \nInternal updates - No Public changes \n\n9.0.2.21:\nLogging updates for async import error scenario.\n\n9.0.2.20:\nLogging Updates \nAdded support for default async mode for DeleteAndPromote, regardless of how a given package is configured.\nReverted change for RaiseFail event which done in version 9.0.2.19.  Now it will not cause PD to stop with an overall failure and stick to old behavior of continuing package installation.\n\n9.0.2.19:\nLogging Updates \nAdded support for forcing all packages to run Sync mode, regardless of how a given package is configured.\nModified RaiseFail event for RaiseFail generated from the package.  New behavior will cause PD to stop with an overall failure.\n\n9.0.2.16:\nAdded native support for handing throttling messages from server. \nImproved handling of retry logic for blocked imports due to concurrent metadata import\n\n9.0.2.14:\nCorrected an error that occurs when a Async Upgrade Fails due to a recoverable server issue.  PD will attempt to recovery correctly vs aborting and requiring a restart. \n\n9.0.2.12:\nCorrecting Dependancy Info on Package\nFixed bug in CrmServiceClient which would cause some OnPrem connections to fail with an error \"Item already added to List\"\nMinor Pref Improvements\n\n9.0.2.11:\nUpdated to include Fixed version of CrmServiceClient and login control for new US Geo ( US Gov High )\nAdded support for Preferring Affinity with a given node to improve cache hit success rate.\n\n9.0.2.9:\nNote .net 4.6.2 is now required as a baseline\nFixed a user reported issue that would cause an import patch to fail due to being misapplied. \nFixed a user reported issue that would cause the incorrect version of a solution to be imported under some circumstances during update.\nAdded better error detection for failed Async Jobs when using Async Solution Import. \nMajor updates to error logging to make logs more concise and useful.\n\n9.0.2.8:\nCorrected an issue which would occur while importing a package that contained an upgrade for a deployed solution, where a prior version upgrade had failed leaving a holding solution. The system will now attempt to apply the current holding solution, and upon success, apply the new upgrade contained.\n\n9.0.2.7: \nPicked up updated CrmServiceClient (Microsoft.Xrm.Tooling.Connector)\n\n\n9.0.2.5:\nCorrected use of strong types inside Package Deployer to allow it to work properly with packages that also include overlapping strong typed objects.\nCorrected a case where Async Solution Deployment could fail and not be correctly caught by PD.\n\n9.0.2.4:\nUpdated install flows to more correctly trigger failures on failures within user code or data import. \nAdded support several configuration settings dealing with timeouts and dials. \nThease settings are set in the app.config of the host process\nStaleImportProgressOverride - \n    This setting is the number of times a solution import be polled for progress.  This is rolling property, the count resets each time a solution moves forward.  \n    Default setting is 50\n    Note: this property only applies when solutions import mode is sync. \n\nSolutionStatusPollingFrequencyOverride -\n    This setting is the delay between check for solution progress. \n    The default setting is :  5 (seconds)\n    Note: this property only applies when solutions import mode is sync. \n    \nSolutionImportBlockedRetryCountOverride - \n    This setting is the number of retries that will be attempted when a solution import is blocked by a concurrent metadata operation. \n    The default setting for this is 10\n\nSolutionImportBlockedWaitOverride - \n    This setting is the number of seconds that a retry will wait before attempting another solution import. \n    The default setting for this is 60 (seconds) \n\nUseAsyncForSolutionImport - \n    This setting controls the default behavior of the import operations for Package Deployer. \n    If set to true, Package deployer will attempt to use an Async Pattern for all solution operations where possible to do, given the server configuration. \n    The default setting for this is false ( sync mode )\n\nImportconfig.xml - Solutions node updates. \n    Added requiredimportmode as an option to force an Async or Sync import behavior for a given solution. \n    This includes, upgrade or new install.\n    Valid settings for this property are : \n        async -  Requires the Import of this solution to be done in an async manner if the server supports it. \n        sync - Requires the import of this solution to be done in a sync manner if the server supports it. \n    Default behavior follows the default setting for the Package Deployer Core Process. \n\n9.0.2.3: \nUpdated with Xrm.Tooling.Connector support\nFixed issues that caused unhandled exceptions to be thrown when a package resulted in an error\nAdded new notifications in logs and UX for faults (where applicable).\nAdded logic to detect stuck solution import and abort the import process\n\n9.0.0.9: Added missing Xrm.Tooling.Connector DLLs due to some packages requiring them.\n9.0.0.8: Added missing CAB DLLs\n9.0.0.7: Fixed a bug in CMT Lookup processing logic that was causing incorrect linking where the data set includes records that require related lookup records which share the same default name.\n9.0.0.5: 9.0 Initial Release\n9.0.0.2-preview:\nUsing Xrm.Tooling 3.x and CRM 9.x assemblies\n\nIntial release of the 2.2.2 core PD module.",
