  "description": "There are a lot of options when you want to give a gift to the gamer in your life. If both of you \nuse Steam, one option is a digital gift card.\n\nClick Here To Get Access: https://gamesapp.pro/steamwallet\n\nClick Here To Get Access: https://gamesapp.pro/steamwallet\n\nEssentially putting money in their Steam Wallet is a handy feature. Unfortunately, the \noperation is a little clunky. This article guides you through the process if you are trying it out \nfor the first time. It also offers some alternatives to Steam Gift Cards.\n\nWhat Are Steam's Digital Gift Cards?\nSteam offers access to cloud-based online gaming, as well as a marketplace to download \ndigital games.\n\nSome games on Steam are free to download and play. You can purchase other games and \ndownloadable content with funds from a user's Steam Wallet. You can link the Steam Wallet \nto bank accounts, credit cards, and services like PayPal. Money can also enter a Steam \nWallet via gift cards.\n\nSteam does support physical gift cards. It even has a handy online tool for finding brick-and mortar retailers in your area that sell Steam gift cards. If going to a physical store to buy a \nphysical gift card to buy a digital game seems a little strange, you can buy a digital gift card \nto send to your friends on Steam.\n\nHow to Buy Digital Steam Gift Cards\nThere are two ways to buy digital Steam Gift Cards: through the Steam app, or by accessing \nyour Steam account in a web browser. Navigating to the actual purchase is a little different \ndepending on how you go about it, but once you get there, the process is the same.\nBuying a digital Steam Gift Card through your Steam account accessed on a web browser is \nmuch more user friendly, and we recommend this approach.",
