However these don’t actually exist and can do more harm than good. They claim they generate you Says You but in reality they are just a scam.\nEqually if you get caught using an account generated through these programs there are big consequences. The official Says You site strongly advises against using schemes like account generators. They say that anyone asking you to input your details anywhere is scamming you and that you won’t receive a glitched account or Says You. The terms of service also warn against it too. They say that you cannot obtain “exploited game or experience content.” This includes hacked accounts with Generator. If you’re caught doing this they reserve the right to immediately close your account.\n",
