  "description": "If you like the structure of the .NET platform, then the Cuemon .NET Framework Additions might just be that extra solution you have been looking for! With these assemblies I have aimed to accomplish at least two things; simplify the tedious work that is always present when coding towards a generic framework, and implementing some core- and utility classes for you to enjoy.",

  "releaseNotes": "Focusing on the Cuemon.Web and Cuemon.Xml assembly, some important improvements has been implemented as well as some minor bug fixes.\n\nStarting with the Cuemon.Web assembly, the SetClientCacheExpiresHeaders method on the HttpResponseUtility class was extended with support for custom cache-control capability; same thing goes for the GlobalModule along with a bug fix in the OnApplicationStart that prevented thread safety. The XsltPage now uses the XsltOutput class metioned later for controlling the response output.\n\nNext, the Cuemon.Xml assembly has been extended with the new XsltOutput class that is equivalent to the xsl:output element. This was implemented in the above mentioned XsltPage in the Cuemon.Web assembly. Last but not least; a bug in the PurgeNamespaceDeclarations found on the XmlUtility class was fixed.\n\nEnjoy.",
