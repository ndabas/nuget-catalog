  "releaseNotes": "3.5.3\n        - SetList and related methods which allow operations on collections fixed.\n        - Power function on LargeInteger improved for efficiency.\n    3.5.2\n        - Bug fix: Using SetList and SelectListSet would prevent deferred setter code such as population of primary key.\n\t3.5.1\n\t    - Random instantiated in static context so multiple instances of populator in quick succession don't repeat random sequences.\n\t    - DeleteAll() now sends all Sql commands in a single batch.\n        3.5.0\n            - Added a DeleteAll() method to the populator. Implemented for the Sql Populator.\n              Caution: Will throw if foreign key violation because of dependencies on generated \n              rows introduced by external processes.\n        3.4.1\n            - DateTimeOffset works with Sql Server DB populator.\n        3.4.0\n            - Expicit foreign key / priamry key property assignment. Useful for foreign key records\n              that have multiple foreign keys pointing to different instances of the same table/type.\n            - Works with DateTimeOffset\n            - Can set max string length in Code Generator.\n            \n        3.3.5\n            - Bug fix: Escaping single quote for explicitly set string property when using the Sql Server populator.\n    \n        3.3.4\n            - Fixed: BindInATransaction method on the Memory populator now calls the existing Bind method.\n            It was doing just a no op.              \n\n        3.3.3\n            - Minor breaking change:\n            - 1. Transation options parameter removed from the BindInATransaction method.\n            - 2. Transaction options are now set on the Sql populator interface.\n            - BindInATransaction method is now available in the IPopulator base interface. \n            - Memory populator implements a No Op for it.\n            - The pacakge now has the correct updated library. Previous package had an older version.               \n    \n        3.3.2\n            - Array randomizer was calling ToString on a constructed value. Could cause an exception if thrown in ToString.\n            - Direct call to Make on the Populators will remove the RecordReference from being tracked before returning.\n            - Ability to remove a single Populatable (Record Reference or operable list of) on the populator.\n            \n        3.3.1\n            - Bug fix: array/enumerable directly requested from the populator via Add or Make was throwing. \n            - Deferred values now work on nested properties.\n            \n        3.3.0\n            - BindInATransaction method off of the SQL populator returning an IDisposable transaction wrapper object.\n              Ie: Using a transaction scope with multuiple DBs such as for EF and TestDataFramework doesn't work in the cloud/Azure. \n              This is to fix it.\n            \n            - Improvements to bundled TestDataCodeGenerator. Eg: Load all table names in one click.\n              MaxAttribute added to numeric columns thatg can have small precision. Eg: The framework will respect maximums\n              for randomized values when number of significant digits is small in floating point DB types.\n        \n        3.2.1\n            - long integer arguments to the Min and Max attributes now work with floating point value generation.\n    \n        3.2\n            - Added Min and Max attribute handling to all scalar and floating point type handlers.\n        \n        3.1.4.1 No TestDataFramework changes.  TestDataCodeGenerator.exe utility bug fix.\n    \n        3.1.4\n            - ToString on generated objects will not be called in the log messages. \n              Some ToString implementations were causing an an exception.\n            \n            - Catching exception on SetProperty in the property population code.\n        \n        3.1.3         \n            - Attempting constructors from least number of parameters to greatest number of parameters.\n            - Swallowing exception if one occurs during constructor invocation on a target object.\n             \n        3.1.2        \n            - Added missing overload for GuaranteeByFixedQuantity in the derived OperableLists.\n              Was missing overload taking IEnumerable<T> and an explicit fixed quantity\n              \n\t\t3.1.0\t\t\n            - Removing state from a service. Allows the same populator object to be used in generation\n\t\t\t  of an explicitly set property value.\n\n\t\t3.1\n\t\t \t- Deep setting of properties.\n\n\t\t\t- Deep setting of object graph properties beyond a collection.\n\n\t\t\t- Make an object in one line via Make and BindAndMake.\n\n\t\t\t- Ignore a property (to avoid possible side effects).\n\n\t\t\t- Exclusive range of possible values for a property.\n\n\t\t\t- Take and Skip operations for control of what subsets of a collection explicit setters apply to.\n\n\t\t\t- Better encapsulation. Less public/protected member exposure.\n    \n\t\t2.4\n\t\t*\tBug fixes:\n\t\t\tValue type and enum constructor parameters were not being populated.\n\t\t\tUnsigned integer properties were causing code to break.\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t2.3.1\n\t\t*\tBug fix. Constructor finder was finding a constructor for a string with a char array parameter.\n\t\t\tWas trying to invoke it. Now circumventing this for value/string types and arrays.\n\t\t\tPopulating those constructor arguments directly.\n\t\n\t\t2.3\n\t\t*\tPopulator will now attempt to resolve constructor with parameters.\n\t\t\tConstructors are attempted from least number of parameters (including zero) to most number of parameters.\n\t\n\t\t2.2.4.0\n\t\t*\tBug fix. When calling deferred value generator, was including record references that were not populatable, and therefore null.\n\t\t\tThis was causing a null reference exception when the generator tried to access a method (GetType()) off the null record.\n\t\n\t\t2.2.3.4\n\t\t*\tAbility to ignore properties. Useful to avoid side effects of properties with logic in the setter.\n\t\t\tNew RecordObjects convenience property on the OperableList<T> result collection type. Instead of \n\t\t\tuser having to write the LINQ statement to select out the RecordObjects.\n\t\t\n\t\t2.2.3.2\n\t\t*\tAll setters on a property are executed in turn.\n\t\n\t\t2.2.3.1\n\t\t*\tSupport for enums\n\t\t\n\t\t2.2.2.0\n\t\t\n\t\t*\tBug fix. A combination of explicit/deep property setting and collections in the target object were \n\t\t\tcausing a null ref exception.\n\t\n\t\t2.2.1.0\n\t\t\n\t\t*\tFixed bug in deep explicit property setting, same issue as in 2.0.4.4. It's a relatively rare edge case.\n\t\t\tCalling Make/BindAndMake on an operable list will call the persistence layer only once for entire list.\n\t\t\tWas calling once per element. Will save database round trips when DB populator is used.\n\t\n\t\t2.2.0.0\n\t\t\n\t\t*\tDeep explicit setting of properties.\n\t\n\t\t2.1.0.0\n\t\t\n\t\t*\tIntroduction of the ability to get a value immediately by calling Make() or BindAndMake().\n\t\t\tThis is without needing to call IPopulator.Bind() separately to get values on the whole set \n\t\t\tof requested objects.\n\t\t\n\t\t2.0.4.4\n\t\t\n\t\t*\tBug Fix. Setting explicit value off of an interface didn't identify the concrete object's\n\t\t\tactual (derived) type. Under these conditions, properties weren't being explicitly set\n\t\t\ton the object instance.\n\t\n\t\t2.0.4.3\n\t\t\n\t\t*\tAssembly version properties correction.\n\t\n\t\t2.0.4.2\n\t\n\t\t*\tSyncing C# and Sql Server DateTime values for the Sql Server populator.\n\t\t\tMilliseconds were being truncated on Sql Server but not in C#.\n\t\n\t\t2.0.4.1\n\t\t\n\t\t*\tExtra guard when accessing types from assemblies to be scanned. \n\t\t\tWas throwing a ReflectionTypeLoadException for a particular assembly/type.\n\t\n\t\t2.0.4\n\t\t\n\t\t*\tBug fix: Guid / uniqueidentifier in Sql Server now supported.\n\t\n\t\t2.0.3\n\t\t\n\t\t*\tForeign keys can be explicitly set. Framework will not enforce referential integrity for those \n\t\tproperties if so.\n\t\t\n\t\tAllows you to set a foreign key to null if the matching primary key table isn't in the C# model.\n\t\tReferential integrity errors on the database server can occur if you introduce them this way.\n\t\t\n\t\t*\tInternal methods/members of public facing types are marked as internal (or internal protected) \n\t\tto reduce user's intellisense noise.\n\t\t\n\t\t*\tSkipping assemblies that are not found in the file system during scannig of referenced\n\t\tassemblies for primary/foreign table class matches. An exception had been occuring for some\n\t\tassemblies, possibly becasue they were not in the bin folder due to being in the GAC.\n\t\t\n\t\t*\tAdding an AppSettings key to explicitly enable or disable log messages. The key is:\n\t\t\"TestDataFramework-EnableLogger\". The value to enable logging is \"true\".\n\t\n\t\t2.0.2\n\n\t\tDocumentation is up to date on GitHub.\n\t\t\n\t\t*  Guarantee methods work with primary keys properly.\n\t\t\n\t\t2.0.1.\n\t\t\n\t\t* RecordReference.Set method fix.\n\t\t\n\t\t* Guarantee... methods fix.",
