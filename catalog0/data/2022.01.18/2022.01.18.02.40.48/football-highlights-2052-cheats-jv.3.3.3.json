We don’t know much else at this point and there is no release window announced but we expect the Splitgate upgrade will have a smoother framerate than the Splitgate PS4 and Xbox One versions have currently. 1047 Games also mentioned possibilities of versions on Switch Mac and mobile but the studio hasn’t begun any work for such versions yet.\nFootball Highlights 2052 GENERATOR Football Highlights 2052 UNLIMITED\nWhen Generator are spent in a game the developers will get a cut and this is how they make money.
