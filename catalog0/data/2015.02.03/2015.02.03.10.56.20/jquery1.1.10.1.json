  "description": "JQuery has split into two versions. One that supports older browsers (1.x) and a new version that has dropped support (2+) does not support IE6/7/8.\n      If you build websites and you use the JQuery NuGet package you have to remember to NOT update your JQuery. In addition other packages that have not been\n      tested with verson 2 can use this package as a depedency instead of JQuery to prevent project update errors.\n      \n      Updating JQuery will update your package to version 2+ of JQuery. This package is JQuery1 and can be installed along with jQuery in the same project. \n      At the top of your View you would then include a directive for example like this.\n      \n      \n          <!--[if lt IE9]\n              <script src=\"jquery-1.10.1.js\"></script>\n          <![endif]-->\n          <!--[if gte IE 9]<!-->\n              <script src=\"jquery-2.0.js\"></script>\n          <!--<![endif]-->\n      \n      \n      According to JQuery there will be new versions of JQuery 1.x in the future.  This package will be updated to reflect that change and ease deployment.\n      \n      dking@netpoweron.com",
