  "releaseNotes": "- JavaScript and CSS manager configuration has been integrated into regular Web.config infrastructure.\n\n- Now JavaScript and CSS manager support the concept of \"standalone reference\". This means that such kind of references won't get combined with others, rendering a standalone script tag in the whole page.\n\n- Theming. Calipso introduces a theming approach. Learn more on http://calipso.codeplex.com!\n\n- New globalization string resource approach (check documentation on http://calipso.codeplex.com about string localization).\n\n- Some fixes on JavaScript and CSS manager (design decisions now enhanced or replaced by better ones).\n\n- jQuery is still a mandatory dependency, but Calipso requires it as a reference and it's not included in official distribution. That's it's mandatory to add a JavaScript include in Calipso.config <javascriptManager> element. This is better as newer jQuery version can be plugged in Calipso without waiting for a new Calipso release.\n\n- Now JavaScript script tags are still rendered in the ordered on which scripts were added as references in the server side, but references having an identifier starting with \"Dependency//\" (case insensitive) are rendered first, later the rest. Resources are rendered just after dependencies. \n\n- Client-side JavaScript PageContext, PageManager objects and base Control class are now available through shortcut variables: $calipso$context, $calipso$manager and $calipso$control. Full namespace paths are still fine and this won't change in the future. It's just for make things easier.\n\n- Lot of fixes on JavaScriptManager and CssManager, specially when those work on non-debug compilation mode (release mode on Web.config).\n\nFor more details and how-tos, please visit Calipso's official page on Codeplex http://calipso.codeplex.com",
