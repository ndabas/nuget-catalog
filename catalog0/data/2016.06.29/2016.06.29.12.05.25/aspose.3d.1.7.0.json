  "description": "Aspose.3D is a class library for working with 3D files. It allows developers to create new 3D scene and work with FBX,STL,OBJ,3DS files. It allows you to open files and manipulate the elements in the 3D scene, from line,mesh,nurbs curve, to more complex elements animation, and then export to FBX ASCII, FBX binary, STL ASCII, STL binary, Wavefront .obj and 3DS formats.",

  "releaseNotes": "Public API and Backwards Incompatible Changes\nSee the list for any changes made to the public API such as added, renamed, removed or deprecated members as well as any non-backward compatible change made to Aspose.3D for .NET. If you have concerns about any change listed, please raise it on the Aspose.3D support forum.\n\nAdds Aspose.ThreeD.Entities.Frustum class\nA new class Frustum is added. Camera and Light were the subclasses of Entity class. In the version 1.7.0, these classes are inherited from Frustum and Frustum is inherited from Entity, since the properties Position, Up, LookAt, Direction, Target, NearPlane and FarPlane are extracted into Frustum.\n\nAdds Aspose.ThreeD.ImageRenderOptions class\nIt allows developers to convert a 3D file to image in perspective of the Camera.\n\nAdds multiple Render methods in Aspose.ThreeD.Scene class\nIt renders a 3D scene in given camera's perspective into specified image file format and size.\n\nAdds MoveForward method in Aspose.ThreeD.Entities.Camera class\nIt moves forward the camera towards its orientation. A camera's orientation is specified by any of the Target/Direction/LookAt\n\nTarget: A target node in space, the camera will always look at this target whatever the target/camera has changed its position in space.\nLookAt: A fixed position in space, the camera will always look at this position.\nDirection: A direction vector, a camera's orientation is directly specified by this vector whatever its position is.\nAdds CastShadows and ReceiveShadows members in Aspose.ThreeD.Entities.Geometry class\nSome file formats can store shadow related settings in geometry like FBX, and they're also used in rendering.\n\nAdds GenerateNormal method in Aspose.ThreeD.Entities.PolygonModifier class\nIt allows developers to generate normal data from Mesh instance, if VertexElementSmoothingGroup element was defined on the mesh, the generated normal data will get smoothed by the VertexElementSmoothingGroup.\n\nAdds Concate method in Aspose.ThreeD.Utilities.Quaternion class\nIt allows developers to concatenate two rotation transformation into one represented in Quaternion.",
