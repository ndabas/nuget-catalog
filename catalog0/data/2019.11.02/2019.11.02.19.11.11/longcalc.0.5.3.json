  "releaseNotes": "Unsigned Assembly\n\nThis version corrects a nasty problem with function GetFileMetaData which caused it to always fail.\n\nThis version corrects a nasty problem with bf initialization function 'bf(string FilePath, out FileMetaData MetaData)' which caused it to always fail.\n\nThis version corrects a nasty problem with x.toString, x.Round, x.ToFile which occurred when the base requested for the output was 64.\n\nThis version corrects inaccurate output from x.toString, x.Round, x.ToFile which occurred when x was of very large magnitude or x was very close to, but unequal to, zero. \n\nFYI: In this version, the bf output of x.bfFloor() may have twoexp greater than 0.\n\nThe change which occurred in previous versions to bf initialization from a string (new bf(string x, ...)) such that if x was '1.e+1000', for example, Precision of output was at least 1000 has been reversed to allow the function to proceed without failing in those cases where the exponent part of the input string was very large.  \n\nAdjustments to the trigonometric functions have been made so that hopefully the functions complete faster when the input is extremely large in magnitude. Extremely large magnitude input angles now force the calculation of PI to a precision of at least Log10(angle.Abs() + 1) + 1 + Precision. Ordinarily (for most angles), calculation of PI is not required.\n\nChecks for arithmetic overflow or underflow are again compiler-included in this release.",

  "summary": "This library, built with and accessible by Visual Studio (2019) and using Mpir.NET for the underlying integer math and requiring .NetFramework4.5, supplies a variety of math functions and utilities with precisions as large as 2,000,000 base 10 digits when running in x86 mode and much larger in x64 mode. The underlying objects are bf (for 'big float') real values comprised of an mpz_t extended integer part from Mpir.NET and a base 2 exponent, bcr (for complex numbers expressed in the rectangular coordinates) comprised of a bf real part and a bf imaginary part, and bcp (for complex numbers expressed in the polar coordinates) comprised of a bf radius and a bf angle). Functions supported include real and complex versions of: basic arithmetic, trigonometric functions, log and exponential functions, hyperbolic functions and the inverses of all of these, base conversions between bases up to 64, conversions between rectangular and polar coordinates, and some special functions such as Euler, Bernoulli, Gamma, Zeta, and BesselJ.",
