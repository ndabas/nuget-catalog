  "description": "Bootstrap is a toolkit from Twitter designed to kickstart development of webapps and sites. It includes base CSS and HTML for typography, forms, buttons, tables, grids, navigation, and more.\n\nNerd alert: Bootstrap is built with Less and was designed to work out of the gate with modern browsers in mind.\n\nI've made some very minor adjustments from the repo release to allow for a more common ASP.Net web application directory structure.",

  "releaseNotes": "Previously the docs called for use of .control-label in the examples, but the CSS didn't make clear use of it. This class is required for horizontal forms and has been reflected in the CSS.\nWe've tried our best to improve rendering of buttons and icons across all browsers. Some issues remain; Firefox throws an !importanton line-height for inputs, so that's the big one.\nWe refined the label component style to move away from uppercase.\nAdded the black button option, .btn-inverse.\nAdded a mini button class, .btn-mini.\nWe had to re-add the protocol, http: to the HTML5 schim because IE7-8 wouldn't recognize it, dropping some HTML5 support for those browsers and introducing major performance issues.\nResolved some issues with responsive layouts where media queries would overlap at 768px and 980px.\nRearranged Scaffolding docs page to split fixed and fluid grid systems.\nTons of docs updates for typos and language changes.",
