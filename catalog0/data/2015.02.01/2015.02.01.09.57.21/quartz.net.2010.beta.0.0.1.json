  "releaseNotes": "(copied from Quartz.net website)\nThis version is a major overhaul of of Quartz(.NET) 1.x codebase. Now code is more unit testing friendly (more interfaces) and API is based on generics and .NET 3.5 SP1 features like DateTimeOffset.\nBREAKING CHANGES\n.NET 1.1 and 2.0 support is dropped\nQuartz.NET now needs .NET version 3.5 SP1 or later to run due to use of new language features and classes\n\nMany public interface methods have changed from returning arrays to generic IList or ISet interfaces\nTriggerBuilder implementations and JobBuilder should now be used to create different job and trigger definitions\n\nIntroduced IJobDetail, IContrigger, ISimpleTrigger, ICalendarIntervalTrigger have far less members and especially mutators\nWhen C5 collections were introduced as set-based implementation provider, ISet and ISortedSet interfaces were narrowed (IList inheritance removed)\nstring triggerName, string triggerGroup are now encapsulated in TriggerKey (has the same fields)\nstring jobName, string jobGroup are now encapsulated in JobKey (has the same fields)\nJobInitializationPlugin is now deprecated in favor of XMLSchedulingDataProcessorPlugin, JobInitializationPlugin no longer included\nMicrosoft's Oracle drivers are no longer supported, use 10g or 11g ODP.NET drivers\n\nDatabase schema has changed, you need to convert your 1.x schema to new version, sample migration script available in database folder\nOTHER NOTABLE CHANGES\nXMLSchedulingDataProcessorPlugin uses new XML format that allows more control over triggers but no support for calendars\nThere are extension methods for the new trigger builder that allow you to set trigger specifics\nClient Profile is now supported and there are now separate DLLs for client profile\nPropertySettingJobFactory is now the default JobFactory\n\nThis version roughly corresponds to Java Quartz's version 2.1.",
