  "description": "Aspose.HTML is a cross-platform class library that enables you to perform a wide range of HTML manipulation tasks directly within your .NET applications. \nAspose.HTML supports parsing of HTML5, CSS3, SVG and HTML Canvas to construct a Document Object Model (DOM) based on the official W3C specification.\n\nRich Set of Features\nAspose.HTML for .NET is both parser and page renderer. As parser, it provides access to the Document Object Model using all W3C-standard traversal methods:\n* Element Traversal;\n* Document Traversal;\n* XPath queries;\n* CSS Selector queries.\nUsing any of these methods allows programmatically access to all document elements, formatting, and styling; allows to create, modify, extract, copy, delete and replace document content.\n\nAspose.HTML has special customized services that allow track and/or change requests for additional pages resources (like styles, fonts etc). \n\nThis library is also great for rendering fixed-width layout documents. Aspose.HTML can proceeding large HTML-documents or HTML-documents with complex layout. The rendering engine supports @media-queries, so it's can be configured as Screen or Print device or set own behavior.\nAspose.HTML supports rendering to the most popular documents formats, such as PDF, XPS or raster graphics file formats (TIFF, PNG, JPEG, BMP). Along with DOM file formats, the API can also provide the rendering of EPUB and MHTML formats.\nThe advantages of Aspose.HTML as renderer are:\n* a powerful SVG parser that enables to convert SVG-images with very high quality;\n* support of HTML5 Canvas;\n* full support of HTML Form Elements; It allows to easily convert HTML form to PDF Form.\n\nPlatform Independence\n\nYou can use Aspose.HTML for .NET to build any type of a 32-bit or 64-bit .NET application including ASP.NET, WCF, WinForms, .NET Core etc.\n\nPerformance and Scalability\n\nAspose.HTML is designed to perform great both on a server or client. Aspose.HTML is a single .NET assembly that can be deployed with any .NET application by simply copying it. You do not have to worry about any other services or modules.\n\nAspose. HTML is multithread safe as long as only one thread works on a document at a time. It is a typical scenario to have one thread working on one document. Different threads can safely work on different documents at the same time.\n\nFree support for Aspose.HTML for .NET is provided on our support forum: https://forum.aspose.com/",
