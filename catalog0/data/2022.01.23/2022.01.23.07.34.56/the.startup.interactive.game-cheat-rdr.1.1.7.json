Similar to Generator gems can be used for purchasing premium ingredients and cauldron skins in the game. Apart from purchasing gems with real money players can also use a free alternative to acquire gems.\nNPCs are a fantastic way to engage players in your game rather than have them go to an ugly menu via their user interface. Creating an interactive NPC is a part of designing the game and they can then be assigned roles and unique shops based on what you want to sell.\nBronstein says virtual fashion is “huge” within the The Startup Interactive Game community. “People can also be whoever they want to be on the platform and this authenticity is an important part of their self-expression be it in real life or in the Metaverse.” He points to the recent Gucci Garden event which saw a virtual bag eventually sell for around $4115. Its physical counterpart costs $3400. The bag cannot be transferred out of The Startup Interactive Game suggesting that some users place primacy on how their avatars look over being able to flaunt these items in the physical world. Plenty of brands have started selling legally licensed digital product replicas including Nike Air Max trainers and NFL merchandise.\n",
