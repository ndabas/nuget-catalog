  "description": "Archero hack iOS cheats:\n\nArchero hack is a fairly difficult game, but fortunately there are a few tricks that everyone can use to achieve an advantage. We're not planning to recommend downloading a hacked APK (which opens up your device to a myriad of nasty malware), but you will find still numerous Archero cheats, hacks, and glitches that don't require any sketchy methods.\n\n\nCHECK HERE >>>> https://rebrand.ly/archero\n\n\nWe've collected the best techniques below, including both simple Archero gameplay tips and mild hacks that need force closing the game. For even more information on Habby's hit game, make sure to check out our other Archero guides at the links below! Archero hack gems would be the game's premium currency and you'll need a lot of these to unlock the best heroes in the game. Sure, you can get them from the shop, but with a little patience (and assistance from an easy Archero hack) you are able to farm them pretty easily.\n\n\nGems are made as a reward for clearing stages and leveling up, but there are a few more active ways to collect them as well. The first (and easiest) is to view the daily ad from the home screen, which gives 30 gems, some sapphires, and a little boost of energy.Archero hack gems and that's by spinning the lucky wheel after defeating bosses. The lucky wheel won't appear if the devil appears (take damage to avoid this), and you should have to view an offer first. You are able to only get these rewards five times each day, and there is a chance you'll get coins instead of gems.",
