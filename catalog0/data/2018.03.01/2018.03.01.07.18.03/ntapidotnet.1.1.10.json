  "releaseNotes": "1.1.10\n------\n* Added support for extended handle information to allow for PIDs > 64k.\n* Added basic New-NtToken cmdlet and system call.\n* Added Resolve-NtObjectAdddress cmdlet to resolve the addresses of a list of objects.\n* Added generic object ReOpen method.\n* Added vistor method to object directories to enumerate recursively with a callback.\n* Added display of process trust labels.\n\n1.1.9\n-----\n* Fix for bug when querying extended process information on Windows 7/8.\n* Add OneDrive file attributes from thierry.franzetti.\n* Added support for displaying child AppContainer names.\n* Various improvements to section editor including integer data inspectors.\n\n1.1.8\n-----\n* Better support for relative paths in the cmdlets including supporting ones based on the current directory.\n* RenameEx and DispositionEx support from fllombard.\n* Added Key value deletion and fixes from rsiestrunck.\n* Fixed bug in NtOpenSession prototype.\n* Added support for adding additional groups to a token in Get-NtToken if user has SeTcbPrivilege.\n* Added Show-NtToken to display a token in the GUI, renamed old whois style token viewer to Show-NtTokenEffective.\n* Added PowerShell functions to get and create execution alias reparse points.\n* Added section viewer and editor with Show-NtSection function.\n\n1.1.7\n-----\n* Added projects to build NtObjectManager for PowerShell Core 6.0\n* Added additional techniques to open process tokens in access checking cmdlets.\n* Fixed issues with Add-NtKey and added Remove-NtKey cmdlets.\n* Minor fixes from fllombard\n* Added change notify key with asynchronous support\n* Added kernel LUID allocation\n\n1.1.6\n-----\n* Added support for child process policy and desktop app policy to Win32ProcessConfig.\n* Added new mitigation options from Win10 1709.\n* Fix a couple of crashes.\n\n1.1.5\n-----\n* Fixed crash on 32 bit Windows when enumerating NT types.\n* Merged ManagedHandleUtils assembly into main NtApiDotNet under the Win32 namespace.\n\n1.1.4\n-----\n* Added Show-NtSecurityDescriptor function.\n* Added support for modifying security descriptors in the UI.\n* Cleanup of access mask when being displayed in the UI.\n* Added opaque reparse buffer.\n\n1.1.3\n-----\n* Added Show-NtToken function.\n* Added basic version checking for certain functions which can't be accessed on Windows 7.\n* Fixed referenced System.Management.Automation assembly version to run properly with no PS2.\n* Fixed some bugs in token structures which preventing being used with multiple values.\n* Added support to Win32Process for LPAC.\n\n1.1.2\n-----\n* Added Get-AccessibleHandle cmdlet.\n* Support for oplock levels.\n* Added support to set inherit and protect on close flags to objects.\n* Added Get-NtFilePath function.\n\n1.1.1\n-----\n* Fix to native protected process creation.\n* Added functions to create native NT processes.\n\n1.1.0\n-----\n* Removed check tools, excluding CheckNetworkAccess.\n* Added basic Job object cmdlets.\n* Added creation of protected processes in Win32Process.\n* Added service access checking cmdlet.\n* Added get executable manifest cmdlet.\n\n1.0.9\n-----\n* Made New-Win32Process more generic and added support for Win32k filter enable.\n* Added function to capture token from a process using impersonation.\n* Added basic support for Desktop and WindowStation objects using Win32u.dll exports.\n* Added file locking implementation including async.\n* Added hardlink enumeration.\n* Added NTFS stream enumeration.\n* Deprecated most of the old standalone utilities in favour of PS cmdlets.\n\n1.0.8\n-----\n* Added cmdlets to create a kernel memory dump, system environment and licensing.\n* Additional system calls implemented.\n* Added access to secure boot policies and code integrity policies.\n* Made Win32 Process creation more generic and added cmdlet.\n* Added access check by type including SELF SID.\n\n1.0.7\n-----\n* Added new cmdlets to do access checking. Many of the old standalone utilities are now deprecated.\n* Added cmdlets to create lowbox tokens\n* Added list of known capability SIDs and resolve them during name lookup\n* Added cmdlet to get a SID\n* Added cmdlet to do a standalone access checking\n* Reworked the APIs to include non-throwing versions of many of the core Open/Create methods.\n* Made NtType more inspectable, includes access enumeration and rationalizes the opening methods.\n* Various additional properties such as extended process flags, checking for LPAC\n* Rework of access mask handling. Now all low-level APIs use an AccessMask structure which has\n  conversion operators to and from other enumerations.\n* Various other bug fixes.\n\n1.0.6\n-----\n* Added cmdlet to filter a Token object.\n* Cleanups to various components to make them easier to use from PS\n\n1.0.5\n-----\n* Added additional Known SIDs\n* Unified the variant Get-NtToken* cmdlets into one.\n* Added additional token cmdlets such as Logon and Clipboard.\n* Added initial support for IO Completion Ports\n* Added object creation time property\n* Added support to set a process device map\n* Added top level CanSynchronize property to NtObject\n* Bugs fixes from Rustam Agametov\n* Made process list in token viewer a list rather than a tree and made a separate handle tab.\n\n1.0.4\n-----\n* First NUGET release.",
