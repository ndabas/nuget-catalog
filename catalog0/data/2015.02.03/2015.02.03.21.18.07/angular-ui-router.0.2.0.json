  "summary": "AngularUI Router is a routing framework for AngularJS, which allows you to organize the parts of your interface into a state machine. Unlike the $route service in Angular core, which is organized around URL routes, UI-Router is organized around states, which may optionally have routes, as well as other behavior, attached.\n\nStates are bound to named, nested and parallel views, allowing you to powerfully manage your application's interface.",
