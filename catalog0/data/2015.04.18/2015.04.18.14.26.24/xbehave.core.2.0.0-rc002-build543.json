  "releaseNotes": "### New\n* Based on xUnit.net 2.0 and supports all new xUnit.net 2.0 features.\n* `x()`, an alternative to `f()` and `_()`.\\*\n\n### Changed\n* When a step fails, all following steps in the scenario are reported as skipped. In xBehave.net 1.x, all following steps in the scenario were reported as failed.\n* The `Before()` and `After()` methods of a `BeforeAfterTestAttribute` are now called before and after each scenario is run. In xBehave.net 1.x, these methods were called before and after each step within a scenario was run.\n* [[Object disposal]] and [[Teardown]] are no longer represented as a separate test unless they fail. This aligns with the behaviour of most xUnit.net 2.0 runners which show an extra failed test when test clean up fails.\n\n### Removed\n* `Given()`, `When()`, `Then()`, `And()` and `But()`. Use `f()`, `_()` or `x()`\\* instead.\n* [[Timeouts]] have been removed under the same rationale used for [xUnit.net 2.0](http://xunit.github.io/docs/test-migration.html).\n* [[Isolated steps]] have been removed as this is a rarely (if ever) used feature that adds considerable implementation overhead.\n* [[Object disposal]] without passing a context object to `Using()` (deprecated in 1.x).\n* An undocumented feature which allows global continuation of step execution when certain types of step fail.\n* An undocumented feature which allows omission of arguments from scenario names in test output.\n\n\\* *Work in progress - not yet provided in the current pre-release package.*\n\n* rc-002: added Xbehave.Core package\n* rc-001: switched steps following a failed step from failed to skipped, added x(), tweaked messaging behaviour\n* beta-008: Fixed NCrunch support and re-introduced BeforeAfterTest support.\n* beta-007: Fixed Resharper runner support and removed flawed BeforeAfterTest support.\n* beta-006: Fixed VS runner support.\n* beta-005: Updated to xunit 2.0.0 (stable) and restricted platform support to .NET 4.5 only.\n* beta-004: Fixed test output for steps which are failed fast due to failure of preceding steps. \n* beta-003: Fixed test class construction and disposal and changed behaviour of BeforeAfterTestAttribute. \n* beta-002: Added support for Windows 8.1+ (Universal), Windows Phone 8 (Silverlight), Windows Phone 8.1+ (Universal).\n* beta-001: Initial beta.\n",
