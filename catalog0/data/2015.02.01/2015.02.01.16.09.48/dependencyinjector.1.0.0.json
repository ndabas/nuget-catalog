  "description": "Created to avoid big libraries in my code. The aim is to keep things small and simple as long as possible. With this tiny library you can build object graphs and pull them out from the container at need. This was my primary requirement, and is what I'm already doing with several other containers. But the containers are pretty big and not everyone knows them well enough. Anyone can get to know these few hundered lines of code.
