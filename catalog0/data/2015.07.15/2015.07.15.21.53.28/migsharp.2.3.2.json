  "releaseNotes": "2.3.2\n- added support for MySql (thanks to mediocreguy)\nBUG FIXES:\n  - fixed scripting of Unicode literals\n2.3.1\n- added support for row-version columns (new .WithRowVersionColumn(columnName) method)\n- added support for ON DELETE CASCADE (new .CascadeOnDelete() method on foreign keys) (thanks to Marko Binic)\n- new console application that generates a migration from an existing SQL Server database schema (Generate.exe)\nBUG FIXES:\n  - removed experimental MySql from the default list of supported providers\n2.3.0\n- new DropIfExists method on tables\n- DateTime2 columns respects OfSize parameter (#50)\n- added scripting support for DateTime2\n- Scripting a DateTime or DateTime2 value includes 3 digits of miliseconds according to ISO 8601 with a dot as a decimal mark\n- Error log contains exact information about the failed migration.\nBREAKING CHANGES:\n  - Change of DataType class: size and precision are now nullable:\n    -> the 'scale' parameter of the 'OfSize' methods is nullable\n    -> a size equal to 0 means 'is set to zero' now\n    -> validation messages might contain the string 'null' (where they had '0')\nBUG FIXES:\n  - SQL Server Providers: use 'tinyint' for DbType.Byte (instead of 'smallint')\n2.2.0 \n- Added possibility to execute a migration without versioning it (useful for dynamical schema changes)\n2.1.0 \n- Added support for custom timestamp formats (see Wiki on how to use this feature) (thanks to richardprior)\n- Added support for custom DB connections which is needed for SQLite in-memory databases (thanks to jvandertil)\n- Added support for SQL Server 2012 (2.0.0 was already compatible but we've added an official provider now)\n2.0.0 \n- Added support for SQL Server CE 3.5 (thanks to balistof)\n- Duplicate migration exports are detected before actual migration execution\n- API:\n- IMigrationBatch now lists:\n- migrations scheduled for execution\n- migrations executed server-side but unknown to the application (used to detect if an application is out-of-date)\n- Removed Migrator.IsUpToDate as it is ambiguous and incurs an extra round-trip to the database (use FetchMigrations instead)\n- IVersioning: implementors need to return all executed migrations instead of answering Contains(...)\n- IVersioning and MigrationEventArgs: use the new IScheduledMigrationMetadata interface which contains the direction\n- BUG FIXES:\n  - SQL Server 2005/2008:\n    - before dropping a column, drop its default constraint (if exists) (thanks to rmotyka)\n    - SQL Server CE 4:\n    - allow GUIDs to be used as primary keys (thanks to lestermat)\n  - Teradata:\n    - stop creating *_0 tables when adding foreign keys\n1.1.0\n- Added support for SQLite (without foreign keys)\n- Added support for SQL scripting: instead of executing migrations against a database, they can be scripted into files\n- Added command-line interface: Migrate.exe, a console application\n- Added support for retrieving migrations from multiple assemblies (thanks to FlorianHoornaar)\n- Extended/completed list of allowed primary key data types for all providers\n- Providers define themselves which data-types can be used for identity columns\n- this allows to use decimals without scale for SQL Server, Oracle, and Teradata\n- Extended API to allow renaming of primary keys\n- Removed .AsIdentity() option when adding columns (was not implemented consistently and was missing integration testing and constitues a super special-case which is hard to implement consistently for all platforms)\n- IProvider: added the DropDefault method which replaces the AddedColumn.DropThereafter and gives the providers more flexibility to report what they support and what not\n- Teradata: raise validation error on adding/dropping primary keys (Teradata does not support that)\n1.0.2 \n- BUG FIXES:\n  - SQL Server 2005/2008:\n    - rename default constraint along with the column (fixes the case when adding a new column with a default value which has the same name of a previously renamed column with a default value)\n  - Oracle:\n    - rename identity sequence and trigger along with the table\n  - Teradata:\n    - escape new name when renaming a table\n    - removed MINVALUE and MAXVALUE for identity columns which is not needed and caused unexpected errors\n1.0.1 \n- BUG FIXES:\n  - Oracle: multiple Mig# instances can be maintained side-by-side on the same database\n  - SQL Tracing: do not throw if the emitted SQL contains curly brackets\n1.0.0\n- Initial release\n\nNote: Mig# uses \"Semantic Versioning\" http://semver.org/ (by Tom Preston-Werner)",
