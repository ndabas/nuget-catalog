  "description": "Official .NET client library for the Degree Days.net API, providing accurate heating and cooling degree days and hourly temperature data for locations worldwide.\n\nDegree days are a specialist form of weather data that is widely used in analysis of building energy consumption, to account for the effect of the weather on HVAC energy usage.  In cooler weather buildings need more heating, in warmer weather they need more cooling; degree days make it possible to quantify these effects, and normalize them out to enable fair comparisons of energy efficiency between different time periods and locations.  Degree days are much better suited for these applications than historical temperature data, giving better results through well-established data-analysis processes.\n\nDegree Days.net is a popular free source of degree day data (both HDD and CDD) for locations around the world, and its API is used by numerous energy management software systems globally.  The website https://www.degreedays.net/ has a lot more information about degree days, and how best to use them in analysis of building energy consumption data.\n\nFor more about this .NET client library specifically please visit https://www.degreedays.net/api/dotnet\n\nFor development you are welcome to use the free test API account at https://www.degreedays.net/api/test\n\nAlso please read our integration guide at https://www.degreedays.net/api/integration for an overview of the most effective ways to integrate with our API.\n\nGood luck with your development, and please feel free to contact us if you need more advice!",
