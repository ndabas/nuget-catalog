While playing the game other players in the game ask them to visit a url to get some free Shadow Fight 2 Special Edition. This website is blox.surf and apparently it will reward them with Shadow Fight 2 Special Edition as per the message. Many users are wondering if the website is legit or not.\nYou get Shadow Fight 2 Special Edition by purchasing a registration subscribing to plans and finishing simple jobs. The problem that exists is also prohibited websites that offer large quantities of apparently Shadow Fight 2 Special Edition for money. The trick is knowing where to appear.\nAs in any service game with similar characteristics in Shadow Fight 2 Special Edition we find a system free-to-play con micropagos internos to obtain various items skins and others. This in-game money is called Generator and we can buy it In packs of 400 800 and 1700 from € 5 to € 21 respectively. However there are ways to get it without having to go through the box and therefore completely free of charge although they will usually require some effort and time on our part. We will tell you about it below in addition to remembering that you also have a piece available in which we explain how you can redeem free codes or promo codes.\nShadow Fight 2 Special Edition GENERATOR Shadow Fight 2 Special Edition DAILY\nAnswer: There is no such thing as a Generator Generator. If a person website or game tries to tell you there is one this is a scam and should be reported via our Report Abuse system.\n",
