  "description": "Cocoon ORM is a simple to use .Net open source alternative to the Entity Framework and nHibernate created for SQL Server 2008/2012/20014/+, SQL Azure (but workable in other T-SQL database environments), and MySQL. It is an ORM toolset that performs: automapping, auto CRUD (including select joins), auto SQL, auto stored procedure parameter mapping, and more. It creates easy to inspect parametrized SQL that is execution plan and cache friendly. The SQL that Cocoon ORM generates is the same SQL you yourself might write had you the time.\n\nCocoon ORM is for developers who are unwilling to trust the Entity Framework or NHibernate to create and manage their database and database code. Cocoon ORM developers should be comfortable with SQL Server and MySQL as well.\n\nNOTE. Some features will be disabled in the MySQL database adapter.\n\nWebpage: http://guidelinetech.github.io/cocoon-orm/\n\nThe goals of Cocoon ORM\n\nLeverage simplicity and elegance.\nSave time\nReduce bugs\nMassivly reduce the amount of code required for database access.\nFeatures of Cocoon ORM\n\nRequires no special training; examples are plentiful and directly applicable to your code today.\nIncludes regression and benchmarking tools for the truly performance paranoid.\nDirectly compare performance between Cocoon dynamic parametrized SQL and that of traditional stored procedure.\nLeverages data annotations similar to that of the Entity Framework.\nCan be used in a simplified code first or a concise code second environment.\nRudementary table generation tools are provided primarily as a time saver; not to remove the need for the developer to understand the underlying database structure.",
