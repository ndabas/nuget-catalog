  "description": "It is well documented open source server/client framework.\nAllows remote method calls from client to server and from server to client easily. Can throw exceptions across applications.\nAllows acynhronous or synchronous low level messaging instead of remote method calls.\nIt is scalable (15000+ clients concurrently connected and communicating while server has only 50-60 threads) and fast (5,500 remote method calls, 62,500 messages transfer between applications in a second running in a regular PC).\nAllows clients to automatically reconnect to the server.\nAllows clients to automatically ping to the server to keep the connection available when no communication occurs with the server for a while.\nAllows a server to register events for new client connections, disconnecting of a client, etc.\nAllows a client to register events for connecting and disconnecting.\nIt is suitable for long session connections between clients and server.",
