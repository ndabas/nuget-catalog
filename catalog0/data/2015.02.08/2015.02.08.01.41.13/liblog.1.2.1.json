  "description": "If you are a library or framework author and you wish to provide logging support in your component there are a  number of options: 1) Depend on a specific logging framework 2) Depend on Common.Logging 3) Implement your own ILog interface and make your consumers wire it up.\n\nOption 1 is not desirable because it forces your users to use a particular framework. Option 2 is not desirable because it will add yet more nuget package dependencies and project references with associated versioning concerns in addition to wiring up. Option 3 is desirable because it is dependency free but requires that your users to remember to write an adapter and wire things up.\n\nThis package is a variation of option 3 but will automatically wite thigs up too.\n- It will add an ILog, ILogProvider etc to YourRootNamespace.Logging\n- ILog is 2 methods to implement in comparison to Common.Logging ILog's ~65 members\n- Using reflection, it transparently supports NLog, Log4Net, EntLib Logging and Serilog without any wiring up required by an end user.",
