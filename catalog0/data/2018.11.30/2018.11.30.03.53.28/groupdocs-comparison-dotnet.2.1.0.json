  "description": "GroupDocs.Comparison for .NET is a lightweight library that allows you to merge and diff two versions of a document. Supported file formats include: PDF, DOC, DOCX, XLS, XLSX, PPT, PPTX, ODT, TXT, HTML.\n\nThe library comes with a web UI that allows you to display differences between documents with a redline change tracking view. The UI can easily be customized and integrated into your own app. You can also build your own UI from scratch or use the library without the UI at all.\n\nKey Features Include:\n\n1. GroupDocs.Comparison identifies not only differences in document contents, but styles changes, including bold/italic, underlines, strikethroughs, font type, etc.\n\n2. Once documents are merged, the library generates a diff summary, listing all the changes found.\n\n3. The library allows you to compare up to 3 Word (DOC/DOCX) files. It also shows which changes come from what document.\n\n4. When comparing Word documents, changes can be accepted or rejected and the result exported to a final document.\n\n5. You can upload documents from streams and send the result output to streams as well.\n\nFor more details on the library, please visit the GroupDocs website at: \nhttp://groupdocs.com/dot-net/document-comparison-library\n\nNote: this download contains a fully working version of the product, however without a license set it will run in evaluation mode with some limitations. To test the GroupDocs.Comparison for .NET library without limitations, please request a free 30-day temporary license.",
