  "releaseNotes": "- Add support for using Equals, ReferenceEquals and CompareTo rather than == operator.\nPrevious Versions:\n- Support AutoIncrement on non-primary key properties\n- Support unordered object commits (without the need for explicit flushes) when using databases that don't support for deferrability\n- Allow direct configuration with connection strings\n- Fixed sometimes queries failing if referencing a primary key on a DAO property\n- Fixed Any function sometimes not working\n- Allow DAO types to be defined in other assemblies\n- SQL server provider now always disables enlistment\n- Switch to using ConfigurationManager for configs\n- Added TransactionScopeFactory\n- Removed dependency on EF\n- Support for ConnectionString rather than pure object or XML configuration\n- Added Azure friendly DeleteDatabaseDropsTablesOnly option for SqlServer\n- Added Azure friendly DisabledForeignKeyContext\n- Support OrderBy in sub-queries on SQL server\n- Support for projecting IGrouping when aggregates are both used and not used.\n- Added support for Queryable.Any\n- Simplified ObjectState logic\n- Fixed bug to do with OrderBy and GroupBy in the same query\n- Fixed GroupBy aggregate bug\n- Better support for booleans and decimals in SQL Server\n- Fixed setting null on deflated object properties doesn't the commit update to the DB.\n- Fixed some sometimes unnecessary UPDATE statements executed following INSERT.\n- Fixed left/right joins using DefaultIfEmpty ignored/swallowed in Mono.\n- Fixed implicit joins in selects sometimes not working when working with explicit Linq joins.\n- Native TimeSpan (interval) support for Postgres providers.\n- Fixed negate (-ve) operation not support in Sql92QueryFormatter\n- Fixed nullable enums on Postgres\n- Added DateTime.Add method support.\n- Fixed comparing DAOs and DAO properties to null sometimes not working.\n- Improved Include() support. Can now include off DAOs that are on projected anonymous types.\n- Added base non-generic DataAccessObject class.\n- Added ObjectAlreadyExistsException for more specific UniqueConstraintException cases.\n- OrderBy and GroupBy now support properties that are are defined on related objects (joins are made automatically/implicitly)\n- Better unified cross-provider exceptions for failed unique constraints and when setting related objects that are missing or undefined objects\n- Fixed implicit join in Where lost when a Select follow.\n- Sqlite provider now converts composite primary keys with more than one auto-increment to a single primary key with a unique constraint across all the composites.\n- DataAccessObjects now has GetReference\n- DataAccessObjects GetByPrimaryKey and GetManyByPrimaryKey now support composite and complex primary keys\n- Support for Include() inside select and on IQueryable.\n- Support for Include() when selecting related objects on objects.\n- Improved composite GetByPrimaryKey support in DataAccessObjects collections.\n- Support recursive Include()\n- Support implicit (recursive) joins when predicating or selecting on related objects\n- Composite primary keys made up of objects are now supported.\n- Improved performance\n- Fixed non-aggregate  count.
