The band released its debut, Devil’s Night Out, in 1989 via Taang! Records. The Bosstones signed to the major label Mercury Records in the early ’90s, issuing there Don’t Know How to Party in May 1993. The group’s most successful album, Let’s Face It, arrived in 1997, peaking at No. 27 on the Billboard 200 and earning a platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of America.
