  "releaseNotes": "Unsigned Assembly\n\nA major problem with the complex-valued functions has been addressed with this version, in which bcp objects (in polar form) were not normalized properly for purposes of calculations. Instead of performing calculations on bcp objects with angles between minus pi and pi, the calculations were performed on those variables with angle between 0 and two pi. This had an adverse impact on many calculations in the complex input/output functions.\n\nA revised set of Zeta functions has been added. They are in static form, with signatures \"public static bf Zeta(string x, uint baseOfString, long Precision)\" and \"public static bcr Zeta(string real, string imaginary, uint baseOfString, long Precision)\". The Zeta calculations are done in such a way that the needed precision of inputs cannot be readily determined prior to entering the functions. The Zeta functions are very susceptible to round-off error and the number of terms to be summed and their precisions requires re-evaluating inputs with the necessary precision after entering the function to try to avoid large round-off error. The earlier Zeta functions remain in the software for backward compatibility.\n\nDue to the more stable new Zeta functions, a more successful attempt at limiting public function outputs to no more than one additional decimal digit beyond that of implicitly or explicitly requested Precisions has been made with this version.\n\nChecks for arithmetic oveflow or underflow are again compiler-included in this release.",

  "summary": "This library, built with and accessible by Visual Studio (2017) and using Mpir.net for the underlying integer math, supplies a variety of math functions and utilities with precisions at least as large as 2,000,000 base 10 digits. The underlying objects are bf (for 'big float' real values comprised of an mpz_t extended integer part from Mpir.net and a base 2 int64 exponent), bcr (for complex numbers expressed in the rectangular coordinates of a bf real part and a bf imaginary part), and bcp (for complex numbers expressed in the polar coordinates of a bf radius and a bf angle). Functions supported include real and complex versions of: basic arithmetic, trigonometric functions, log and exponential functions, hyperbolic functions and the inverses of all of these, base conversions between bases up to 64, conversions between rectangular and polar coordinates, and some special functions such as Euler, Bernoulli, Gamma, Zeta, and BesselJ.",
