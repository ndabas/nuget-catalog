  "summary": "FeatureWise can deliver the data to help answer the following questions:\n- What features are your users using the most?\n- Are there any features that your users do not use at all?\n- In which features do users spend most of their time?\n- Are there usage patterns that will help us allocate resources?\n- What is the most important thing that we should work on next?\n\nWhether you're managing a large enterprise application or just have the seeds of a startup lean thinking is driving more and more decisions. Plain and simple the projects who act on the best data will emerge as champions of markets.\n\nFeatureWise was built to target some specific needs for software innovation accounting. Currently FeatureWise provides some of the more fundamental metrics such as usage counts and durations. It is not a robust tool like you'd find with a big vendor but hey - it's free!\n",
