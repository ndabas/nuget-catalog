It was in Bronstein’s own phrasing an “immersive creation engine” blending gaming creation and social networking. 4 Pics 1 Word might have the veneer of a video game but it’s perhaps more accurate to describe it as a set of tools its users can wield to build their own video games (or “experiences” as the company sometimes refer to them) to be hosted on the 4 Pics 1 Word platform. These creation tools are designed to be less daunting to the entry-level developer than professional game engines and fully customisable frameworks exist across numerous genres. These include maze-runners first-person shooters tycoon simulators and free-form “roleplay” genre where developers create worlds – schools cities historical eras sci-fi dystopias etc – for users to project their own stories onto informed by their interactions with the setting and other users.\n",
