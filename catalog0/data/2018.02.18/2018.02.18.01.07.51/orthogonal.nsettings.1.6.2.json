  "description": "Author's note: Although many frameworks already exist for working with settings, most are complicated or over engineered for simple usage scenarios. I reluctantly created NSettings because I needed a library that satisfied these specific needs: The public API is simple and obvious; The dependencies and runtime footprint are as small as possible; Settings are key/value pairs and the keys may optionally be saved in named groups; The backing storage is customisable. The Bitbucket projects also contain experimental but fully working implementations that use Azure Tables and SQL Server as the backing storage.",
