  "description": "Gepsio is a .NET-based document object model for XBRL documents. Load your XBRL document with the XbrlDocument class and work with your XBRL document exposed as a set of .NET classes with a variety of properties and methods. Loaded XBRL documents are automatically validated against the information against the XBRL specification, and exceptions are thrown when invalid XBRL documents are loaded. The Gepsio code base is unit tested using the XBRL-CONF-CR5-2012-01-24 unit tests designed by the XBRL organization.",

  "releaseNotes": "DESIGN\n======\n* XML services now separated from the main code base into an interface-based design, which positions the code base to cleanly migrate away from an XML DOM implementation and into an LINQ-to-XML implementation compatible with .NET, WinRT, Universal Apps, and Xamarin. See the blog post at http://gepsio.wordpress.com/2014/06/30/positioning-gepsios-xml-service-layer-for-mobile-apps-and-the-windows-store/ for more information.\n* The XLINK specification is now implemented in a specific class, and XBRL linkbase nodes now leverage Gepsio's implementation of XLINK. The following classes have been already refactored to leverage this support (more refactoring will be coming in future releases):\n   * FootnoteArc\n   * CalculationLink\n   * RoleReference (NEW)\n   * ArcroleReference (NEW)\n* The classes designed to support XML Schema constructs have been moved into a separate namespace called JeffFerguson.Gepsio.Xsd to provide a clean separation between the XSD implementation and the main XBRL code. Since the XSD classes are implemented in terms of the interfaces defined and implemented in the XML namespace, the XSD classes do not need an interface-based design; instead, it simply leverages the XML service layer.\n\nNEW CLASSES\n===========\n* The RoleReference class contains information regarding a <roleRef> element found in an XBRL fragment.\n* The RoleReferenceValidationError class contains validation errors discovered in the role reference of a loaded document.\n* The ArcroleReference class contains information regarding a <arcroleRef> element found in an XBRL fragment.\n* The ArcroleReferenceValidationError class contains validation errors discovered in the arc role reference of a loaded document.\n\nNEW PROPERTIES AVAILABLE ON PREVIOUSLY EXISTING CLASSES\n=======================================================\n* The CalculationLink class now contains a property of type Uri called RoleUri. See the blog post at http://gepsio.wordpress.com/2014/03/12/searching-for-balance-sheet-calculations-with-the-sep-2013-ctp for more informaiton regarding the need for this property.\n* The XbrlFragment class now contains a property of type List<RoleReference> called RoleReferences. This collection contains one RoleReference object for each <roleRef> element found in the XBRL fragment.\n* The XbrlFragment class now contains a property of type List<ArcroleReference> called ArcroleReferences. This collection contains one ArcroleReference object for each <arcroleRef> element found in the XBRL fragment.\n\nNEW METHODS AVAILABLE ON PREVIOUSLY EXISTING CLASSES\n====================================================\n* LinkbaseDocument\n    * GetCalculationLink(): Finds the CalculationLink object having the given role.\n* XbrlDocument\n    * GetCalculationLink(): Finds the CalculationLink object having the given role.\n    * GetRoleType(): Finds the RoleType object having the given ID.\n* XbrlFragment\n    * GetCalculationLink(): Finds the CalculationLink object having the given role.\n    * GetRoleType(): Finds the RoleType object having the given ID.\n* XbrlSchema\n    * GetCalculationLink(): Finds the CalculationLink object having the given role.\n    * GetRoleType(): Finds the RoleType object having the given ID.\n\nCONFORMANCE\n===========\n* Changed conformance suite test from using XBRL-CONF-CR3-2007-03-05 to using XBRL-CONF-CR5-2012-01-24 at its source to get around the now-defunct references to UBMatrix.com found in the XBRL-CONF-CR3-2007-03-05 suite. See the blog post at http://gepsio.wordpress.com/2014/07/02/gepsios-xbrl-conformance-suite-unit-test-in-need-of-an-upgrade/ for more information.\n* Validation for footnote as sources in custom arc roles is now supported. See the blog post at http://gepsio.wordpress.com/2014/07/09/better-validation-coming-for-footnote-arcs-and-arc-roles/ for more information.\n* Shares-based units are now validated to ensure that the shares measure is defined within the http://www.xbrl.org/2003/instance namespace. This validation is tested by test variation 3014.15A in the XBRL-CONF-CR5-2012-01-24 Conformance Suite.\n* Monetary item types are now validated to ensure that its unit does not use a ratio-based complex type. This validation is tested by test variation 304.26 in the XBRL-CONF-CR5-2012-01-24 Conformance Suite.\n* Gepsio now reads and supports schema attributes defined within complex types in schemas. Gepsio now looks at schema attributes for \"precision\" and \"decimals\" fixed values and uses those values, if available, if the \"precision\" and \"decimals\" attributes are not found on the item itself. Item validation for pure item types now also runs the decimal item type validation, since the pure item type is derived from the decimal item type.\n* Failures detected during the schema read process are now reported as XBRL validation errors.\n* Role references in XBRL fragments are now checked to ensure that the role URIs are unique amongst the set of all role references in the fragment.\n* Arcrole references in XBRL fragments are now checked to ensure that the role URIs are unique amongst the set of all arcrole references in the fragment.\n\nCONFORMANCE TESTS IN XBRL-CONF-CR5-2012-01-24 PASSED BY GEPSIO\n==============================================================\n* Identifier Scope [Section 4.3  The Item Element]\n    * 301-01-IdScopeValid.xml [301.01 Valid example of id attribute.]\n    * 301-03-IdScopePeriodDiff.xml [301.03  Mismatch of periodType attribute and referenced context's period type.]\n    * 301-04-IdScopeContextRefToUnit.xml [301.04  contextRef has IDREF to unit element.]\n    * 301-05-IdScopeUnitRefToContext.xml [301.05 unitRef has IDREF to context element.]\n    * 301-06-FootnoteScopeValid.xml [301.06  Valid example of footnote link href attribute.]\n    * 301-08-FootnoteToContext.xml [301.08 href attribute is referencing to context element.]\n    * 301-09-FootnoteToUnit.xml [301.09 href attribute is referencing to unit element.]\n    * 301-10-FootnoteFromOutOfScope.xml [301.10 The instance contains two footnote links.

The second one contains an arc with a to value that does not have a corresponding footnote resource in the same extended link.]\n    * 301-12-FootnoteLocOutOfScope.xml [301.12 The instance contains a footnote link.  In the footnote link there is a loc element that has an href that points to a fact in another instance document.]\n    * 301-13-FootnoteLocInScope.xml [301.13 The instance contains a footnote link.  In the footnote link there is a loc element that has an href that points to a fact in the instance document using the instance document file name with a fragment identifier.]\n    * 301-14-FootnoteFromResource.xml [301.14 The instance contains a footnote link. The arc in the footnote link has a from value that matches a footnote resource. This is not valid for the fact-footnote arc role on the arc. The from must point to a loc which in turns points to a fact in the same instance document.]\n    * 301-15-FootnoteToLoc.xml [301.15 The instance contains a footnote link. The arc in the footnote link has a from value that matches a footnote resource. This is not valid for the fact-footnote arc role on the arc. The from must point to a loc which in turns points to a fact in the same instance document.]\n    * 301-16-FootnoteWithoutLang.xml [301.16 The xml:lang attribute is missing on the footnote resource.]\n    * 301-17-FootnoteCustomArcRole.xml [301.17 The footnote custom arc role can relate two footnotes to each other instead of just fact to footnote.  (Only the standard footnote arc role is restricted to being from item or tuple locators.) Maybe this might be used to indicate how some footnote is \"footnoting\" another footnote.]\n* Context Segments and Scenarios [Section 4.4  The Context Element]\n    * 302-01-SegmentValid.xml [302.01 Valid segment in a context]\n    * 302-02-SegmentNamespaceInvalid.xml [302.02 Invalid segment in a context; contains an element defined in xbrli namespace]\n    * 302-03-ScenarioValid.xml [302.03  Valid scenario in a context]\n    * 302-04-ScenarioNamespaceInvalid.xml [302.04 Invalid scenario in a context; contains an element defined in xbrli namespace]\n    * 302-05-SegmentSubstitutionInvalid.xml [302.05 Invalid segment in a context; contains an element in substitution group of xbrli:item]\n    * 302-06-ScenarioSubstitutionInvalid.xml [302.06  Invalid scenario in a context; contains an element in substitution group of xbrli:item]\n    * 302-07-SegmentEmptyContent.xml [302.07 Segment in a context contains an element with empty content]\n    * 302-08-ScenarioEmptyContent.xml [302.08 Scenario in a context contains an element with empty content]\n    * 302-09-PeriodDateTimeValid.xml [302.09 Valid duration context with start date earlier than end date]\n    * 302-10-PeriodDateTimeInvalid.xml [302.10 Invalid duration context with start date later than end date]\n    * 302-11-DecimalAttributeOnSegmentInconsistent.xbrl [302.11 Two contexts are S-Equal even though a decimal-valued attribute in their segment elements have different lexical representations. The contexts are S-equal, so a calculation inconsistency MUST be signaled.]\n    * 302-12-DecimalAttributeOnScenarioInconsistent.xbrl [302.12 Two contexts are S-Equal even though a decimal-valued attribute in their scenario elements have different lexical representations. The contexts are S-equal, so a calculation inconsistency MUST be signaled.]\n* Period Type Consistency [Section 4.3  The Item Element]\n    * 303-01-PeriodInstantValid.xml [303.01 instant context and item defined with PeriodType=\"instant\"]\n    * 303-02-PeriodDurationValid.xml [303.02 duration context and item defined with PeriodType=\"duration\"]\n    * 303-03-PeriodInstantInvalid.xml [303.03 duration context and item defined with PeriodType=\"instant\"]\n    * 303-04-PeriodDurationInvalid.xml [303.04 instant context and item defined with PeriodType=\"duration\"]\n    * 303-05-ForeverElementewithInstancePeriodTypeReportedasForever.xbrl [ForeverConcept with Instant Period Type is not allowed]\n* Unit of Measure Consistency [Section 4.4 The Context Element]\n    * 304-01-monetaryItemTypeUnitsRestrictions.xml [304.01 An element with a monetary item type has an ISO currency code for its units (using the standard ISO namespace prefix).]\n    * 304-02-monetaryItemTypeUnitsRestrictions.xml [304.02 An element with a monetary item type has an ISO currency code for its units (using a non-standard ISO namespace prefix).]\n    * 304-03-monetaryItemTypeUnitsRestrictions.xml [304.03 An element with a type derived by restriction from the monetary item type has an ISO currency code for its units.]\n    * 304-04-monetaryItemTypeUnitsRestrictions.xml [304.04 An element with a type derived by restriction from monetary item type has an ISO currency code for its units (using a non-standard ISO namespace prefix).]\n    * 304-05-monetaryItemTypeUnitsRestrictions.xml [304.05 An element with a non-monetary item type has an ISO currency code for its units (using the standard ISO namespace prefix).]\n    * 304-06-monetaryItemTypeUnitsRestrictions.xml [304.06 An element with a monetary item type does not have an ISO currency code for its units - the namespace is wrong.]\n    * 304-07-monetaryItemTypeUnitsRestrictions.xml [304.07 An element with a monetaryItemType does not have an ISO currency code for its units - the local name is wrong.]\n    * 304-08-monetaryItemTypeUnitsRestrictions.xml [304.08 An element with a type derived by restriction from monetaryItemType does not have an ISO currency code for its units - the namespace is wrong.]\n    * 304-09-monetaryItemTypeUnitsRestrictions.xml [304.09 An element with a type derived by restriction from monetaryItemType does not have an ISO currency code for its units - the local name is wrong.]\n    * 304-10-pureItemTypeUnitsRestrictions.xml [304.10 An item with a pureItemType data type MUST have  a unit element and the local part of the measure MUST be \"pure\" with a namespace prefix that resolves to a namespace of \"http://www.xbrl.org/2003/instance\".]\n    * 304-11-pureItemTypeUnitsRestrictions.xml [A measure element with a namespace prefix that resolves to the \"http://www.xbrl.org/2003/instance\" namespace MUST have a local part of either \"pure\" or \"shares\".

In this case the requirement is not satisfied because the schema reference has to be resolved using the XML base attribute that ensures the schemaRef URI resolves to the XML document in the base directory.  This document, however, is a label linkbase, not a schema.  If the XML base attribute value is not used then the schema in the same directory as the instance is discovered and no issues are noticed.]\n* Duplicate instance roleRef and duplicate arcroleRefs [3.5.2.4.5 and 3.5.2.5.5 duplicate instance roleRef and arcroleRef elements.]\n    * 308-01-instance.xml [Instance contains two role references to the same URI, INVALID]\n    * 308-02-instance.xml [Instance contains two arcrole references to the same URI, INVALID]\n* LAX validation tests [Test that LAX validation is performed]\n    * 314-lax-validation-01.xml [Segment has an element for which there is no definition, so it is allowed; item has an attribute with no definition, so it is allowed.
