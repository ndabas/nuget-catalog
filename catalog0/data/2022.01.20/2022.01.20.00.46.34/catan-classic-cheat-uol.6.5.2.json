Unfortunately not everyone has the real-world currency to purchase Generator.\nThe games can vary massively in terms of quality and content and there appears to be very little quality control from Catan Classic themselves. This doesn’t mean that all of the games are bad there are thousands of amazing games to play on the platform but it can sometimes take a bit of digging to separate the good from the bad.\nThat being said there are a few things to note. First this is not an official way of getting Generator. It might be possible the developers would ban users who obtained Generator via this method since it’s not a legitimate way to get the in-game currency. Therefore users are advised to bear caution while using these websites to get Generator.\nAfter completing the tasks assigned to your profile ZoomBucks will present you with the option to redeem your accumulated rewards for the exclusive Generator gift card.\nThese are all the active working Catan Classic promo codes as of July 2021:\nCatan Classic - Catan Classic GENERATOR\n",
