  "description": "Pádraig Pearses take on Kilmacud Crokes in the All-Ireland Senior Club Championship semi-final today.\n\nThis marks Roscommon and Connacht champions Pearses' first foray into the All-Ireland series after their maiden Connacht crown was well-earned in overcoming Knockmore on a scoreline of 1-13 to 1-11.\n\nClick here==> https://tinyurl.com/mppnc2pm\n\nThey will take on three-time All-Ireland winners Kilamcud Crokes who are well-versed in competing at the business end of All-Ireland championships.\n\nPearses had corner forward Paul Carey to thank after his significant contribution if eight points in the victory over Knockmore.\n\nCarey seemed to have no issues with angles or distances as he kicked over a generous variety of seemingly improbable scores on the day to lift his side.\n\nKnockmore came back at them as the second half progressed but in truth, Pearses had stretched out in front by enough of a margin to make withstanding a comeback a relatively comfortable job.\n\nAnother star forward who has had a huge influence on his side's fortunes is Crokes' Paul Mannion.",
