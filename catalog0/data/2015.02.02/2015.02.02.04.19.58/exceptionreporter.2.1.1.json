  "releaseNotes": "First Nuget version, last features include:\n- Configuration Tab shows entire config XML file (not just application section)\n- Configuration Tab shows XML file in formatted HTML\n- Added Less/More detail button - toggles between showing just the exception message or the dialog as normal (for users who get confused with too much information)\n- Support for multiple exceptions (ie a list of exceptions)\n- A custom message can override the main message (ie Exception.Message)\n    Screenshot saved in jpeg (rather than .bmp) to reduce file size\n- New API exposed, so that programmers can create a report, programatically, without showing a dialog (see ExceptionReportGenerator class)\n- AppVersion and AppName config properties can now be set manually - previously, although they were public properties, they would be forcibly overriden by ExceptionReporter as part of gathering application/system properties",
