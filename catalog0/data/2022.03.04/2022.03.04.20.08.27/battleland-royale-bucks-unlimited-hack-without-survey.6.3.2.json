It's totally up to you to decide on who lives and who dies. You get to control everything with a simple click of your mouse. You can build, dig, hunt, fish, and fight with other Battleland Royale gamers online for points and money.\n\nThe story behind the Battleland Royale is that a corporation has produced an illegal drug called Battleland. Battleland pills are highly addictive and once addicted, your brain becomes programmed to use them constantly. This causes your mind to make poor decisions that will cost you money in the game. However, if you are able to control your brain during gameplay, you can earn more money, buy upgrades for your gun, and even recruit new Battleland Rangers to help you in the game.\n\nThe Battleland Royale Hack is one of the many free downloads available to Battleland Royale players. To get this Battleland Royale Hack, all you have to do is open the game, then log into Battleland to see what changes have been made.
