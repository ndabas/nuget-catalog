  "description": "This package provides a transactional view of a file system and an in-memory simulator for that view. This makes it easy to test code that interacts with the file system.\n\nThis is not your typical files and directories API. There is a single instance that represents the entire file system. File and directory objects are bound to a file system instance and all the instances related to a single file system share consistent state.\n\nWhole-system savepoints are built in and you can revert to the last savepoint at any time.",
