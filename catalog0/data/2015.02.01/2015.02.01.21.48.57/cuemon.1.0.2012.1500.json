  "description": "If you like the structure of the .NET platform, then the Cuemon .NET Framework Additions might just be that extra solution you have been looking for! With these assemblies I have aimed to accomplish at least two things; simplify the tedious work that is always present when coding towards a generic framework, and implementing some core- and utility classes for you to enjoy.",

  "releaseNotes": "The primary focus for this release was the new JsonWriter class (and associated; JsonInstance, JsonInstanceCollection, and JsonTextWriter) in the Cuemon assembly together with the new XmlConvertUtility class, XmlJsonInstance class and some bug fixing of the XmlSerializationUtility class - all three found in the Cuemon.Xml assembly.\n\nFirst things first; the new JsonWriter was designed for speed (in compliance with RFC 4627) why the design is initial; this means no runtime validation of of your JSON writing. However - as a proof of concept - a fully working XML to JSON implementation has been made available on the XmlConvertUtility class; ToJson(Stream) and ToJson(Stream, Encoding).\n\nNext, a new helper method has been introduced on the ConvertUtility class; ChangeType(String). The purpose of this method was to easily determine if a string value can be cast to a more suitalbe Type such as Boolean or Numeric value. An example of this can be found when converting XML to JSON.\n\nLast but not least, minor refactorings has occured through out the Cuemon assembly family and a bug in the XmlSerializationUtility was located and fixed. Last mentioned now fixes possible serialization issues when serializing classes with no public constructor and again opens for working overrides of WriteXml for custom serialization scenarios.\n\nI hope you will enjoy this release as much as i did creating and maintaining it :-)",
