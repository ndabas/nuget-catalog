  "releaseNotes": "This release is the first version of the rebranded OData Client for .NET. Previously this library was known as the WCF Data Services client. The client has been rebranded to better reflect the functionality of the client. This version of the client includes the support described below for consuming OData v4 services.\n\nWhat is in the release? \n\n•        Feature Parity \nThis release supports the same set of features that were supported in version 5.6.0 of the WCF Data Services Client. This release supports OData v4 only and is not backwards compatible with OData versions 1-3. \n\n•        Customizable code gen via T4 template\nThis generation of the client has support for code generation using a customizable, parameterized T4 template rather than the previous code gen experience that was not customizable.\n\n•        Enum support \nThe client now has support for code generation of enum values and properties.\n\n•        Singleton support\nThe client now has support for code generation of singleton values. You can now compose a LINQ query using singleton values.\n\n•        Containment support \nThe client now has support for contained values.\n\n•        JSON format as default\nThe JSON format is now the default format requested by the client. \n\nKnown Limitations \n• This release of the OData client targets functional equivalence with the 5.6.0 release as well as support for a few new features. This means that there are many new OData v4 features that are not supported yet in the client.\n• Although the OData client is capable of serializing the OData v4 Atom format, this functionality is not officially supported since the Atom specification has not yet made it to the CS02 stage.",
