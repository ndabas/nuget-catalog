  "releaseNotes": "1.1.0 - Rewrote Ptr class to include delegate marshaling and better optimization. Memory leaks for strings taken care of.\n\nFuncPtr class removed. Along with the awkward (pointless?) UnPin extension.\n\nAdded IntPtr extensions for easy marshaling/pointer dereferencing. \n\n1.0.9 - Changed library to 4.5.1 to take advantage of generic Marshal class methods. Simple structures without arrays and containing pure native types use IL functions for (de)referencing.\n\n1.0.8 - Uses IL functions for pointer operations with native types in Ptr class. PtrToStructure is now used only for complex structs.\n\n1.0.7 - Changed pointer math operators to return IntPtr value instead of dereferencing the pointer. Added UnPin extension method.\n\n1.0.6 - Fixed pointer math operators to take pointer's type size into account. Added a generic Fixed structure for pinning objects.\n \n1.0.5 - Added constructors for FuncPtr class for either pointer or delegate.\n\n1.0.4 - Added ChangePtrSize method for Ptr class allowing you set a new size for pointer with option to reallocate. Changed namespace to VBUnmanged.\n\n1.0.3 - Added Dispose method for Ptr class. Updated test code.\n\n1.0.2 - Allows for arrays to be used in initializing Ptr class. Includes string arrays which subsequently turns the Ptr into an array of IntPtr's with each element pointing to the string.",
