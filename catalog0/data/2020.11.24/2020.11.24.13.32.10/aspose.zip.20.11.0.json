  "description": "Aspose.ZIP for .NET is a flexible and easy to use .NET API that lets you work with files compression in standard zip, bzip2 and UStar tar format. It saves you time and efforts by allowing you to achieve compression/decompression of files and folders without going into the underlying complexity of the compress file formats.\nAspose.ZIP provides you the capability to password protect the ZIP archives with traditional as well as AES encryption techniques. The API is easy to use, robust and written in managed code entirely to be used in .NET applications.\nAspose.ZIP for .NET is implemented using Managed C# and can be used with any .NET language like C#, VB.NET, F# and so on. It can be integrated with any kind of application, from ASP.NET web applications to Windows applications.It also provides fully featured demos written in both C# so that developers can get up and running quickly. Using parallel compression of zip archive with several entries can gain up to 5x speed increase. \nAspose.ZIP can be used to perform a variety of tasks in applications. For example:\n\n    -Compress files and folders to standard ZIP format using standard Deflate, Bzip2, LZMA or PPMd compression algorithm.\n    -Decompress files and folders\n    -Password protect ZIP archives\n    -Support for traditional password protection schemes\n    -Encrypting archives with AES Encryption schemes\n    -Support for AES 128, AES 192 and AES 256 Encryption techniques\n    -Apply different protection scheme to each file in an archive\n    -Append files to zipped archive\n    -Use parallelism to achieve efficient compression\n    -Pack files and folders to tar archive and compress it with gzip or bzip2\n    -Compose self-extracted archives\n    -Compose 7z archives with LZMA or LZMA2 compression and optional encryption\n    -Extract simple 7z archives with LZMA compression and without encryption\n    -Extract RAR4 and RAR5 archives.",
