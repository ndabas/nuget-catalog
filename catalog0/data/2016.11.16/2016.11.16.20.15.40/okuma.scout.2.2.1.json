  "releaseNotes": "# SCOUT CHANGE LOG README #\n\n* Last Compile date: 10/13/2016\n* SCOUT Application      - Version 2.10.1.0\n* SCOUT Test Application - Version 2.2.0.0\n* Okuma.Scout.dll        - Version 2.2.1.0\n* Okuma.Scout.Com.dll    - Version 1.0.0.0\n\n\n##[ NOTES ]##\n> #### ► About COM library: ####\n>\n>  * If the following classes accessed, Okuma.Scout.Com.dll must be deployed with Okuma.Scout.dll\n>    1. COM_InterfaceImplementation\n>    2. LicenseChecker\n>    3. AccessGAC\n>\n>  * Okuma.Scout.Com.dll is accessed by the main SCOUT library by means of [Registration-Free COM Interop](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/fh1h056h(v=vs.110).aspx), which requires the use of manifest files.\n>  * Any executable that will use the COM library must have a manifest file that declares Okuma.Scout.Com as a dependant assembly. Please refer to the sample application. \n>  * While developing an application which uses SCOUT, you ####MUST#### disable the Visual Studio Hosting Process! Failure to do so will result in File Not Found exceptions as a result of the hosting process executable not matching the manifest file for the application.\n\n► Only .NET versions are checked in command-line 'native' C++ \n     code (with no .NET requirement). The bulk of SCOUT is \n     contained in Scout.exe which is unpacked and ran \n     if .NET 2 or later is found.\n\n► Due to the differences in Data Management Cards on older OSP controls,\n     the output from them may contain little or poorly formatted data.\n     This does not affect compatibility results.\n\n\n### Contact Information ###\n\n* For general programming questions related to Okuma products, we recommend asking your question on stackoverflow.com with the tag \"okuma\".  \n Refer to the following link to view all Okuma questions:  \nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/okuma?sort=newest&pageSize=50  \n* For detailed, specific, or bug related questions, please email your question to API@Okuma.com\n\n\n##[ KEY ]##\n   [中] = SCOUT Library\n   [本] = SCOUT Application\n   [全] = Library　and Application (whole project)\n   [■] = Fully implemented\n   [♦] = Implemented, not tested\n   [◊] = New request\n   [‡] = Not implemented request; will not add \n\n\n#[ CHANGE LOG ]#\n►　[ 2016-10-13 / Release 2.10.1.0 (SCOUT Lib 2.2.1)  / SS ]\n  \n  * [中■] Fixed a bug where exceptions are thrown if the OSP-P folder exists, but OSP-P\\CNS-DAT\\ does not.\n\n  * [中■] Fixed a bug where API type reports API version Cross Reference is missing if THINC API files are installed to the GAC, but the machine type is PC.
