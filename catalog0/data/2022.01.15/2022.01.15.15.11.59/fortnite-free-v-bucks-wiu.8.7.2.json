The internet as we know it today wasn’t developed by any one single entity but built collaboratively around open standards and protocols including notably net neutrality. Whether such principles would govern this would-be internet successor is a topic of debate. If any company were able to consolidate power over the Metaverse’s formation and become its de facto gatekeeper the control they could wield over the dissemination of information and in setting their own commercial and security practices would be enormous.\nMr. Rich will drop a Cyclops Eyeball once defeated.
