  "description": "This is a .NET library of utility functions in a functional style in C#. These functions are intended as to be used as part-educational tool, part-useful work tool. That is to say that the functions are supplied in source code form and you, the lucky consumer, can look at the code and understand the algorithms used (and suggest alternatives, should you wish). It also means that, after downloading the package, you will need to link the source code files from your NuGet packages directory to your project.",
