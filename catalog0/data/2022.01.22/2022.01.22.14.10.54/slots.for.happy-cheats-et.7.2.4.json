First off as mentioned above don’t tell your kid the password to their Slots For Happy account. The reason behind this is the ‘Slots For Happy’ scams that proliferate the internet. These sites get your details by disguising themselves as sites that look like an official Slots For Happy page and encourage people to log into their Slots For Happy account via their page to claim ‘Slots For Happy’. If you do this you have just given the scammers all of the information they need to take over the account and clear it out.
