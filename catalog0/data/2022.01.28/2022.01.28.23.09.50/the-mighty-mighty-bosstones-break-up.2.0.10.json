The band released its debut, Devil’s Night Out, in 1989 via Taang! Records. The Bosstones signed to the major label Mercury Records in the early ’90s, issuing there Don’t Know How to Party in May 1993. The group’s most successful album, Let’s Face It, arrived in 1997, peaking at No. 27 on the Billboard 200 and earning a platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of America. The record also featured the Mighty Mighty Bosstones’ most notable single “The Impression That I Get,” which has been certified gold by the RIAA.\n\nNate Albert left the Mighty Mighty Bosstones in 2000. Two years later, the group released A Jackknife to a Swan, its final album before a hiatus that lasted from 2004 to 2007. The group’s first album back from its break was 2009’s Pin Points and Gin Joints.\nThe Mighty Mighty Bosstones released their final studio album, When God Was Great, in May 2021 via Hellcat Records. The band’s final lineup included four of the founding members: Dicky Barrett, Tim “Johnny Vegas” Burton, Ben Carr, and Joe Gittleman.",
