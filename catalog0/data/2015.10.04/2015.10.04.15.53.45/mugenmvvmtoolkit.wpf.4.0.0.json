  "description": "This package contains the WPF assemblies.\n      Mugen MVVM Toolkit makes it easier to develop cross-platform application using the Model-View-ViewModel design pattern.\n      The Mugen MVVM Toolkit provides a cross-platform MVVM development framework built on top of:\n      - WinForms\n      - WPF\n      - Silverlight 5\n      - Silverlight for WP8, WP8.1\n      - Xamarin.Android\n      - Xamarin.iOS\n      - Xamarin.Forms\n      - WinRT XAML framework for Windows 8 Store apps\n      The MVVM framework includes the following features that differs this project from other frameworks:\n      - Deep integration with each platform.\n      - Supports state preservation and restoration for mobile platforms.\n      - Full Fragment support for Android, you do not need to worry about activity, fragments, sub-fragments or their state all this makes the framework.\n      - Solves the nested user controls problem in MVVM, all view models are dynamically created by you, using the GetViewModel method and you do not need to use the ViewModelLocator.\n      - Supports all kinds of navigation like modal window, page navigation, tab navigation, back stack fragment navigation for android. You can also easily add a new kind of navigation.\n      - Navigation system works with view models and allows to expect the completion of the operation. You can pass any parameters between view models.\n      - Good design mode support, for xaml platforms supports the creation of design view model with any constructor parameters.\n      - Supports bindings on all platforms, all of the native binding features available for WPF platform available on all platforms and even more.\n      - Binding supports C# language expressions like Linq, Extension methods, method call, ternary operator (?:), coalescing operator (??), etc.\n      - Supports subscription to any control event.\n      - Built-in support for validation.\n      - You can easily write their own extensions for bindings.\n      - Supports attached members (properties, events, methods), you can extend any object as you want.\n      - Special editor for WinForms, you do not need to write code to create bindings.\n      - Binding parser builds syntax tree that allows you to easily change or extend the bindings, without manipulation of the raw text.\n      - Binding supports fluent syntax.\n      - Excellent binding performance.",
