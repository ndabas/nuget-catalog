  "description": "Welcome to Academy Collections.\n\nAs result of a deep research, Academy.Collections presents new data structures implementations that expands your boundaries when using Microsoft .NET Framework. The objects implementations and the structure of the library is presented in need-order instead of a group of data structures categories, this way the name of the collections and methods (what an end user interacts with) provides better suggestion of its functionalities.\n\nThe collections implemented do not belong to a deep-inheritance group of base collections, but integrate to the Microsoft .NET Framework collections interfaces plus other new (well integrated) interfaces. This way the dependencies are minimized and the collections performance grows to its best.\n\nIn Academy.Collections you will not find any collection contained in the Microsoft .NET Base Class Library (System.Collections namespaces), those are pretty good implementations. This library tries to present new features through a group of innovative collections using similar names, descriptions and concepts that Microsoft did in the Microsoft .NET Framework BCL Collections. This way your code experience will be as intuitive as always has been.",
