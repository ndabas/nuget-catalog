  "description": "NeoFace Engage is a platform / SDK that developers use to add functionality and video analytics to applications developed using Microsoft Kinect for Windows Software Development Kit 2.0 and Kinect Ambient Intelligence Toolkit . The Kinect Ambient Intelligence Toolkit extracts meta-data from video captured by the Kinect camera. Video is analyzed and meta-data is extracted in real-time including person dwell-time and spacial data to understand product interactions. When coupled with NeoFace Engage, retailers and others can extract additional information including the age and gender of faces captured by the Kinect Sensor. This combined meta-data can be pushed to Azure for storage and further analysis, or used to drive targeted content to digital displays, test marketing messages, and capture consumer / product interactions per demographic.",
