  "releaseNotes": "- Added Mapping Adapter – Mapper into SDSHub, and  SDSerialzier won’t  contains its own Mapper( only in SDSHub).\n      - Custom Serializers now can be added by SDSHub/not by SDSSerializer(as earlier)  – that will be used in all next created SDSerializer.\n      - SDSerializer  now  will have  dependency  for DDDD.BCL – Validator and Extensions now will be there.\n      - DomainModel  feature  added to SDSerializer: each serialzier now will be able to export its DomainModel, and after time load it.\n      - then we can transmit DomainModel  and with the help of Mapping  we’ll be able to build the same but client-side-serializer, inited like  its  server-side-sorce-serializer, and in back direction.\n      - SDSHub became now the privilege point  only  that can manage by SerializeGenerators. SDSerialzier won’t  contains its own SerializeGenerators.",
