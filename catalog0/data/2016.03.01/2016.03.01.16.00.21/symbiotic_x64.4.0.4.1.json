  "description": "Feature summary:\n.  Small and simple to use and understand.\n.  Single file reference needed.\n.  Full object hierarchy CRUD support. Saves all object properties and the relationships to related tables. Also supports collection properties.\n.  Allows developers to write sql as needed for reads. The design just maps the results to the objects. Writes are tightly coupled to the database and build on primary key constraints.\n.  No inheritance requirements, uses either interface implementation or attributes.\n.  Allows developers to modify the relation sql to further optimize loading of children.\n.  Sql Server bulk insert support.\n.  Lazy initialization support, with child sql override.\n.  Change trackng support to history tables.\n.  Supported databases: Sql Server / Express / Local DB, My Sql, Sqlite, Oracle, PostgreSql.\n. Built-in Performance tracking, implement IPerformanceTracking to allow performance tracking of all database actions.\n. Optimistic concurrency support.\n. No configuration files needed.\n. Trace output of SQL statements and parameter values.\n. Password one way hashing support.\n. Field level encryption with auto decrypt upon load ability.\n. Processing intercept support, BeforeInsert, BeforeUpdate, BeforeDelete, AfterLoad.",

  "releaseNotes": "Version: 4.0.4.0\n\n12-Apr-2014\nReviewing performance tracking code.\nResearching parallel processing options.\n\n10-Jan-2016\nFound/Fixed a bug that broke support for IDatabaseDefineSupport features.\n\n25-Jan-2016\nResearching support for GUID primary keys support.\n\n26-Jan-2016\nAdding support for GUID primary keys.\nResearching extending support for existing schemas, supporting relationships that don't have a dedicated relation table.\n\n27-Jan-2016\nHave non hierarchy GUIDs working\n\n28-Jan-2016\nHave hierarchical GUIDs working. Need methods to load objects based on GUIDs.\nWorking on extending relationship support.\n\n30-Jan-2016\nHave hierarchical GUID loads working.\nWorking on extending relationship support, have two new attributes: DatabaseRelationOneToOne, DatabaseRelationOneToMany.\n\n04-Feb-2016\nWorking on extending relationship support.\nWorking on a new relationship interface for advanced relationship support.\n\n05-Feb-2016\nWorking on One to One parent child support with no relation table.\n\n06-Feb-2016\nHave the new One to One relationships working.\nStarting on the new One to Many Relationship.\nFound and fixed a bug in DeleteChild method, was not deleting the record when multiple relationships and one having a list of children existed on a parent object.\n\n07-Feb-2016\nHave the new One to many relationships working.\nTesting the new relationship types with non GUID ids.\nImproved error message for column to property type mismatch error, now throws DatabaseColumnTypeMissmatch instead of ArgumentException, also includes the type name of the object loaded.\n\n10-Feb-2016\nTried supporting .Net Core, just too many issues at this point. Reflection being the main one.\n\n17-Feb-2016\nWill start providing database specific provider libraries, make it easier to get started. User can still use the existing method of using a DatabaseTypeFactory class.\nWorking on new nuget packages, and proving a better getting started guide.\nChanged IChangeTrackingSupport implementation to use universal time: DateTime.Now.ToUniversalTime\nAdded support for nullable types.\nAdded a lot of new comments in the unit tests to explain the ORM features.",
