  "description": "Extension methods providing high performance deep copy capability for of arrays of common value types - currently: byte, char, short, int, long, and their unsigned brethren where applicable.\nConsiderably faster than Array.Copy - and it's also faster than Buffer.BlockCopy in most situations!\n\nHigh-performance enabled through use of optimised 'unsafe' blocks.\n\nThis package could be a good addition to other packages if you're building in copying of some kind that would benefit from being fast.",

  "releaseNotes": "Added additional methods to some types to harmonise them. Now all types have equivalent functionality.\n\nExposed a performance copying method, for those who might want to use it (running with scissors warning applies: method uses 'unsafe' techniques with pointer-arithmetic, so bad things can happen if one is careless. You have been duly warned!)",
