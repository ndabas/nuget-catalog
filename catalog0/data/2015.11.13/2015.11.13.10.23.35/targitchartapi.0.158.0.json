  "description": "A chart is a visual representation of data. It could be a bar chart, cross tab or a gauge. It could also just be a plain white number on a colored background.\n\n      Traditionally, TARGIT Decision Suite has provided several standard charts, such as the ones mentioned above. After selecting measures and dimensions for a data object, switching between such standard charts has always been quick and easy.\n\n      Should you wish to view your data as, say, a pie chart that looks like an actual real-world pie or as a bunch of green pulsating dots on an animated radar screen, you would not have been unable to do. Until now.\n\n      Creating and using custom chart is made available for C# developers through our TARGIT Chart API NuGet package, free of charge.\n\n      Through our chart API, a C#/Wpf developer can create custom data object types that literally look like anything you could think of, and effortlessly make them available to end users of TARGIT Decision Suite.",
