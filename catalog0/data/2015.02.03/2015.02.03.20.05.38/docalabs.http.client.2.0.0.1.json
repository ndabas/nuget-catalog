  "releaseNotes": "There are a lot of changes and enhancements. Some major improvements:\n* Ability to map a model properties into the URL's path, e.g. if the RUL is specified like http://foo.com/accounts/{id} and the model as a property named id then the value of that property will be mapped into the path in place of {id}.\n* Ability to specify that some properties must be added as headers, a property must be either marked by the RequstUse(RequestUseTargets.RequestHeader) attribute or be of WebHeaderCollection type.\n* Ability to supply credentials in the model, a property should be of ICredentials type\n* Special treatment of Stream as input or output models.\n* HttpClientFactory will be able to generate plumbing to service call methods that have more than one argument - it'll generate a model class with properties for each argument.\n* Binding is made more flexible, it's possible to do custom binding per model type for each step in the pipeline - mapping properties to the URL, headers, credentials, writing to request body.\n* Ability to get some information about the response - headers, etag, status code",
