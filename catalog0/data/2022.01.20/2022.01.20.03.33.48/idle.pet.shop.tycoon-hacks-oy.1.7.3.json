This will bring up a list of vehicles and you can then double-click on one of them to make it spawn in. After that just walk into the car to take control of it and begin driving around. If you want to get rid of the car you can hit the car icon with the red X on it at the top of the menu to despawn it.\nGiven that the Idle Pet Shop Tycoon audience of players tends to be younger kids it's obvious why so many websites and downloadable browser extensions exist.\n",
