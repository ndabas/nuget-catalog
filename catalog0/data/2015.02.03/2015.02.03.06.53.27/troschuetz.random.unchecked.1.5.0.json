  "description": "DISCLAIMER: This is an \"unchecked\" version of the Troschuetz.Random library, that is, it is a release where all integrity checks have been stripped away to achieve the best performance. Use this instead of the original Troschuetz.Random library IF AND ONLY IF you are certain that your code does not rely on those integrity checks and that it never violates them.\n      Fully managed library providing various random number generators and distributions.\n      More precisely, this library offers four generators (ALF, MT19937, Standard, XorShift128), six discrete distributions (Bernoulli, Binomial, Categorical, DiscreteUniform, Geometric, Poisson) and twenty continuous distributions (like Normal, Exponential, ChiSquare, Beta, and so on); moreover, it offers a random class similar to the one Python offers (TRandom).\n      All the hard work behind this library was done by Stefan Troschütz, and for which I thank him very much. What I am doing with his great project, is simply to refactor and improve his code, while offering the new random class similar to the one Python offers.\n      You can find the modified source code and the available documentation at this address: http://goo.gl/vIV2G",

  "releaseNotes": "* New \"exceptional\" behaviour for most properties, that is, exceptions are thrown when operations are not defined or they would go against distributions checks. In previous release those operations used to silently fail (without corrupting instances, of course).\n      * Library now works fine on .NET framework 2.0, thanks to LinqBridge and Thrower packages.\n      * New discrete distribution (categorical).\n      * Tester has been removed, will be shipped as a separate package.",
