  "description": "Academy.Collections [Beta].\nAcademy is a project to develop a new collection of libraries containing a lot of new definitions and methods to ease your work as developer using the Microsoft .NET Framework. Until now, there is a lot of ideas to develop, the first one to present is Academy.Collections.\nThis library contains new collections which implementation is oriented to what you really need, and do not pretend to bring you a large list of complex data structures names which understanding will remove your developing experience from an easy and comfortable one.\nAs a Microsoft .NET Framework developer your intentions are very far from learn new concepts every time you work with libraries external to the Microsoft .NET Framework BCL. That’s why, Academy.Collections has been implemented using the same principles as Microsoft libraries. Objects and members definitions uses very similar names and features that you are usual to deal with, then your code experience will be as intuitive as always has been.\nWith Academy.Collections we want to bring you, beyond a good performance, a comfortable and easy way to increase your Microsoft .NET platform experience.",
