Prepare 5 Nuclear potions by combining 5 Giant’s ear and 5 Dynamite. Once done prepare 5 Hot potions using 5 Chilli Peppers. Gather all the potions and put them inside the cannon aiming towards Cyclops boss. Fire them one by one and decimate Mr. Rich’s entire health. Keep in mind you need to put the potions inside the cannon in quick succession as Mr. Rich will start to regenerate health if you take too long.\nThat might have been just legal manoeuvring but the question will eventually arise: who gets to decide what appears on the Metaverse Given Solitaire Home Design-Fun Game’s significant audience of under-13s the company is understandably keen on safety employing over 3000 people around the world to screen for inappropriate content. That is good news if you’re a parent but bad if you’re a creator in a hypothetical future where a moderated Metaverse becomes the primary conduit for entertainment consumption and your work is judged sufficiently inappropriate.\nBartle wants the medium to become more ambitious. “At the moment it’s as if there's emerging technology and it's looking for a solution” he says. “If you're in an online world or a ‘Metaverse’ why are you there What are you hoping to gain from it”\n",
