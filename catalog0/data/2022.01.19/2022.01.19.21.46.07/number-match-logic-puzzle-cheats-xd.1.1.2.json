The court battle started last year when Apple removed Epic’s Fortnite from its App Store after the developer had engineered a system to prevent Apple from taking a 30 per cent commission on Fortnite sales to iPhone users. Epic’s defence was couched in the language of worry about how Apple’s behaviour could affect and shape an emerging Metaverse.\nTix also known as Tickets was a currency that was present almost since its launch. Tix didn’t cost money and players could earn by it logging in daily visiting their Place and a number of other ways. Tix could also be converted into Generator which is something players used to do a lot. Considering that it was just a free way to earn Generator people started creating alternate accounts to get more Generator and it almost entirely killed the point of Generator.\nThe Portal-meets-Halo arena shooter Splitgate is perhaps the biggest gaming industry success story of 2021. After languishing for two years Splitgate found major success recently. The free-to-play game has been downloaded more than two million times so far and has received almost universal acclaim. Now there is more good news for Splitgate fans on console as the studio has announced the game will have its own upgraded version for current-gen consoles.\nBut the “open Metaverse” Decentraland gestures towards is still very far away. Bartle the Essex academic says that today most developers are building up discrete and proprietary “walled garden” virtual worlds. “You can't move between them or take what you've got from one world into another” he says. \n",
