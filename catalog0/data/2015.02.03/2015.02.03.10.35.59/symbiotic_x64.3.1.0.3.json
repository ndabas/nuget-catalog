  "description": "The main goal of this library is the simplify data access for Object Oriented programmers. This library provides a simple way to perform CRUD operations. It is not expected to work for everyone or every application. Currently works with SQL Server, Sqlite, My Sql and Oracle.\nI wanted something that would be simple to use, understand, and have very little impact on the code. With this library, you can have basic object CRUD working in less than three lines of code, and should require less than an hour to understand the library usage.\n\nI also wanted something that could easily be integrated into an existing project.\n\nThe basic concept is that you add a few attributes to your objects which explains the mapping to a database results column/s. You can also implement IDatabaseDefineSupport to provide the mapping details.\n\nThere a two main objects used to work with the database. ObjectLoader and ObjectWriter.",

  "releaseNotes": "Version: 3.1.0.3\n\nModified InsertUpdate method, now checks if object has changed prior. Avoids unneeded database activity.\n\n24-Mar-2013\nModified ISqlQuery to support parameters. Begining to code to fully support parameters.\n\n17-May-2013\nEvaluating Dynamic Method support.\n\n23-May-2013\nAdded support for parameters to ISqlQuery and SqlQuerySimple.\n\n27-May-2013\nDynamic methods currently used for object property setting, performance measures indicate over 20% increase in performance.\nModified IDatabaseTypesFactory to better support parameters in ISqlQuery.\nFixed a bug with DataReader handling of nulls, skips nulls.\n\n28-May-2013\nOutstanding issue regarding Dates; seems the parameter inserts do not format the date properly, which is causing problems upon retrieval.\nCurrently working with the Sqlite community to fix the problem.\n\n30-May-2013\nSolved the Sqlite date problem. I was using DBType.DateTime2, and apparently Sqlite does not format DateTime2, \nchanged it to DBType.DateTime and dates are inserted with correct format and retrieved with-out issue.",
