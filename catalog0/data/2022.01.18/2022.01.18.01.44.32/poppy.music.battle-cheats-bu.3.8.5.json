However thanks to these promocodes we can get objects and skins for which we would normally pay Generator.\nDesign our own clothes within Poppy Music Battle: similar to the above but in this case with the distinctive fact that we will need to have a Poppy Music Battle Premium subscription to be able to design and publish clothing pieces for the game’s avatars online. Once in the store we can get up to 70% of the value of each purchase once they are made.\nTechnology circles have long believed some version of this vision can and will feasibly exist – Stephenson himself now works at augmented reality start-up Magic Leap – even if what that would look like exactly when transposed into today’s world is still quite unclear.\nIt’s important to note that while the game is indeed free it contains a decent amount of additional content that must be purchased using an in-game premium currency known as Generator. Generator is used to gain upgrades for your avatar buy special abilities to use in various games new weapons unique objects and more.\nWhen Generator are spent in a game the developers will get a cut and this is how they make money. Almost every game will have something you can buy with Generator and they do a great job of highlighting these within games making it very easy to spend spend spend. We’ll discuss how to get Generator later on but keep in mind that if your kid is playing Poppy Music Battle they will almost definitely start asking you to buy them Generator from the offset.\n",
