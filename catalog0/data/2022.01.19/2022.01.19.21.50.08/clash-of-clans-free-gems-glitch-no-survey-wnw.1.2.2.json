After languishing for two years Splitgate found major success recently. The free-to-play game has been downloaded more than two million times so far and has received almost universal acclaim. Now there is more good news for Splitgate fans on console as the studio has announced the game will have its own upgraded version for current-gen consoles.\nThat 73 percent is much higher than the 30 percent cut taken by Apple and Google’s app stores (in most cases) and the 12 percent cut Epic Games takes from games on the Epic Games Store though admittedly those stores aren’t generally hosting an entire multiplayer game on your behalf. The company will also take a smaller cut if you spend your proceeds within the CLASH OF CLANS FREE GEMS GLITCH NO SURVEY ecosystem such as on ads.\nFree Coins,Free Gems,Free Diamonds,Free Spins, free coins generator no human verification\n",
