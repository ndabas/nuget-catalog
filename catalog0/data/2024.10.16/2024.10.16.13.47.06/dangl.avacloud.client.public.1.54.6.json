  "releaseNotes": "# Changelog\n\nYou can find the full changelog at [DanglDocu](https://docs.dangl-it.com).\n\n## v1.54.0:\n- There is now a validation feature also for XRechnung files\n\n## v1.53.1:\n- Individual `ExecutionDescription.Block` elements now also support the `StandardizedDescription` property for GAEB im- and exports\n\n## v1.53.0:\n- Added `ItemNumberSchemaTier.Alignment` property\n- When importing GAEB 2000 files with invalid item numbers, those will now tried be be preserved (and possibly corrected) instead of simply being ignored\n- When exporting to Excel, it's now possible to lock all cells except those for price inputs\n\n## v1.52.2:\n- When importing Excel files, positions without total price are also now recognized if new element import is enabled\n- When working with **AVA** projects, it's now possible to set `ItemNumberSchema.disableLeftPaddingTiersWithFiller` to `true` to disable automatic left-padding and filling of single tiers in item numbers\n\n## v1.52.1:\n- Fixed a bug in the AVAtoAVA conversion where the specified price rounding mode was not used for total prices if the option to force strict total prices was disabled\n\n## v1.52.0:\n- **AVACloud** now supports XRechnung, the German e-invoicing format. Both a direct representation of the invoice model is available, as well as a conversion to and from the known **Dangl.AVA** format via a wrapper class with additional, required invoice data. This is currently in a preview state, please contact us if you want to learn more about this feature. The documentation is not yet finished, and the feature might change until it's declared stable. In the future, XRechnung might also be available separately as an addon, and may not be part of the core AVACloud offering.\n\n## v1.51.0:\n- When converting AVA to REB, it's now possible to specify the last used row address. This is useful for incremental exports, where the new file should continue with the next free address after the last used one in a previous quantity determination\n\n## v1.50.0:\n- GAEB & Ã–Norm validations no longer return bad requests in case of non-readable files, but instead return validation results with a single critical error stating that the file could not be read\n\n## v1.49.4:\n- `ARM` Docker images for the self-hosted version are now also tagged for stable releases\n\n## v1.49.1:\n- The **Dangl.AVACloud.Admin** app now offers some database maintenance insights and is runnign recurring jobs for general database maintenance (SQLServer only for now)\n\n## v1.49.0:\n- Text addition identifiers in GAEB 90 exports are now left- instead of right-padded\n- When exporting GAEB XML text additions that have an empty body, `<span>` element with a space character is added to the body. This is to prevent Xml schema validation to fail, since the body of a text addition can not be completely empty. When creating offer requests, it is recommended to fill the body with e.g. a placeholder text, such as `..........`\n- Bugfixes in UGL exports\n- The Excel dependency was updated. While functionally the same, the default implementation when deserializing Excel will no longer recalculate Excel formulas. This should not cause issues for real usage, but if Excel files are automatically generated with formulas that should be recalculated, this might cause issues.\n\n## v1.48.0:\n- Updated internal dependencies\n- Fixed an issue with publishing, previously version `2.0.0` of **AVACloud** was accidentally released\n\n## v1.47.0:\n- The new property `PriceInformation.HasUnsetTaxRate` now allows differentiating between projects that have a zero `0` and those that have a `null` tax rate set\n- Fixed some formula conversions in D11 and X31 files\n- Exporting totals in GAEB XML now uses correct rounding, outputs may now produce slightly different values due to that\n\n## v1.46.0:\n- The backend was updated to .NET 8\n- The On Premises variant is now also available as standalone Windows & Linux executables\n- Fixed a bug when importing X31 files with an index in position item numbers\n- Added a new controller called `FlatAvaConversionController`, which supports import and export of flat lists of elements. This is useful for scenarios where working with hierarchical structures is difficult\n- The Oenorm export will now try to export correct `ftnr` values for positions, if strict Xml export options are enabled. This can possibly result in different output than before, but is necessary to export correct files\n\n## v1.45.0:\n- When importing GAEB files, it's now possible to set the `AllowLumpSumItemsWithDifferingQuantities` query parameter to allow importing of lump sum positions that have a quantity different than one. Otherwise, **AVACloud** corrects such positions to have a quantity of exactly `1`\n\n## v1.44.0:\n- Added a new query parameter `IncludeArticleNumbers` when exporting Excel files. If this is set, then a new column with article numbers, read from `position.commerceProperties.articleNumber`, will be included in the output\n- When converting to `Sia`, **AVACloud** now also supports _Ifa18_ as target format. This is controlled via a new query parameter\n\n## v1.43.0:\n- Added support for `Position.PriceCatalogueData`, to transfer price estimation data in GAEB XML exchanges\n- Added `Catalogue.CatalogueTypeDetail` to preserve the actual catalogue type from GAEB XML. It is now possible to differentiate between e.g. versions for the DIN 276 catalogue type\n\n## v1.42.0:\n- Added support for _IDS Connect_ import and export\n\n## v1.14.8:\n- Clients that have passed the GAEB certification with **AVACloud** as their export tool can now export their GAEB files with the mark that the application is certified. This needs to be configured by Dangl**IT** staff, please contact us to enable this for your clients\n\n## v1.41.0:\n- Added support for converting between **Dangl.AVA** and the product data formats `DATANORM` and `UGL`\n- The Admin UI was updated to Angular v15\n- Added support for allowing uppercase item numbers when importing GAEB files",
