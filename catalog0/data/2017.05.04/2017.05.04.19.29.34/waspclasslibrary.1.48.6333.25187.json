  "releaseNotes": "History\n\t  5/4/2017 Version 1.48.1\n\t  Hotfixes\n\t  1. Fixed exception caused by Schwinn Echelon processing unchanged data when bike is not in Stopped state\n\t  \n      3/30/2017 Version 1.48\n      Hotfixes:\n      1. Fixed the AveragePower property of the BikePowerOnly event.\n      2. Qualify AccumulatedStrokeCount in Rower data with capabilities. The AccumulatedStrokeCount will be zero if AccumulatedStrokeCountIsValid is false.\n\t  3. Fixed null reference exception caused by unexpected Fitness Equipment message\n\n      3/16/2017 Version 1.47\n      Features:\n      1. Added Crank Torque Frequency decode. Complete implementation of the Bike Power profile.\n      2. Complete implementation of Fitness Equipment-Control profile.\n      3. Stride and Distance (SDM) profile decode.\n      4. Improvements to the Wahoo KICKR class.\n      5. Added Keiser M3i bike ride modes enumeration.\n      6. Added property to increase UDP socket buffer size.\n\n      Bug Fixes:\n      7. BLE buffer overflow bug fix.\n      8. Polar H7 sensor decode: fix second heartrate reporting.\n      9. Corrected handling for Schwinn Echelon and added gear indication.\n      10. Added a number of checks to prevent null references and out of range exceptions.\n\n      8/19/2016 Version 1.46\n      Features:\n      1. Updated HeartRateMonitor to the latest profile. This includes support for gym mode.\n      2. Added the class MuscleOxygenMonitor to support the muscle oxygen monitor profile.\n      3. Numerous updates to support customer tools, i.e. firmware loader, PoE, and configuration.\n      4. Added support for WASP extended query response.\n      5. Added support for KeiserM3i interval modes.\n\n      Bug Fixes:\n      6. Corrected Bluetooth issue using an ExpandoObject with unknown devices causing crashes. Ticket #215.\n      7. The WASP is now configured for slave receive only mode and will not acknowledge any requested data pages sent to it. This will prevent the WASP from interfering with other WASPs. Note this does not apply to WASP-B. Ticket #219.\n\n      6/29/2016 Version 1.45\n      Major Change:\n      1. The .NET framework target has changed from 4.5 to 4.0 due to client requirements. The Ionic Zip package is now a dependency and classes that we're available in 4.5 are incorporated into the WASP class library.\n\n      Breaking Changes:\n      1. Removed NetworkAddressChanged and NetworkAvailabilityChanged from the NetworkManager class. Note that the WaspCollection class is monitoring these events generated by the NetworkChange class.\n      2. Added IDisposable to the AntDevice class.\n      3. Added IDisposable to the OtaFirmwareUpdater class.\n\n      Features:\n      1. Added support for programming WASP-PoE to the class library.\n      2. Added methods IsPoE and IsWaspN to the Wasp class.\n      3. Added DeviceNumber property to UsbStream class.\n      4. ConfigureForDebugMode changed to a public method in the UsbStream class.\n      5. Added DiscardedMessages property to the WaspDiagnostic class.\n      6. Added Device property to the AntDeviceDiagnostics class.\n\n      Removed:\n      1. Removed deprecated packets per second (PPS) from classes that exposed this property.\n      2. Removed overload SendMessage(AntDevice ant) from the AntRadioChannel class.\n\n      Bug Fixes:\n      1. Fixed GetHashCode and Equals overrides in the Wasp class.\n      2. Fixed a number of areas in the AntData class that had the potential to throw exceptions.\n\n      Known Issues:\n      1. CrankTorqueFrequencyEventArgs is incomplete.\n      2. USB connected WASPs sometimes stop transmitting data. This is handled in the Wasp class by resetting the USB connection and re-enumerating the WASP. No data will be received for several seconds from that WASP.\n\n      4/13/2016 Version 1.44\n      1. Updated the NuGet packaging to use the .targets file to get the SLAB*.dll's and place them in the build output.\n      2. Added support for programming PoE application and radio firmware.\n      3. Added support for over the air programming WASP-N.\n      4. Changed the ANT CommonDataPages enum to public.\n      5. Numerous bug fixes for BLE support, USB, and AntRadio class.\n      6. Added IsButtonPressed property to the Wasp class.\n      7. Fixed GetHashCode method in Wasp class. It was incorrectly returning a reference.\n      8. Added a FuelGauge property to indicate relative battery charge.\n      9. Bug fix in NetworkAddressChanged event handler in the WaspCollection.\n\n      11/20/2015\n      1. The OEMCryptoClass has a static method AddKeys that allow OEMs to add their cryptographic keys. This is a breaking change for OEM branded WASPs when the key is not added to the OEMCryptoClass.\n      2. The USBConnector class now supports WASP-N base station mode.\n      3. Removed ChannelResponseTimeout method from AntDevice class. It is no longer needed.\n      4. Fixed issues with queue/channel management in the AntRadio class. Added overload StartOrQueueChannel(AntDevice ant) to automatically handle channel assignment.\n      5. The Wasp class now provides support for base station mode.\n      6. A new property CollectionVerbosity has been added to the WaspCollection to control trace messages.\n\n      A help file to guide the developer has been added to the package. It is installed in the Help folder.\n\n      11/6/2015\n      Note that this is a beta release.\n\n      1. Changed target framework from .NET Framework 4.5.2 to .NET 4.5.\n      2. Class AntRadioEventArgs - the second constructor takes a message that begins with the length.\n      3. Improved error handling, particularly for burst transfers.\n      4. Upgraded USB support for both WASP-B and WASP-N.\n\n      9/28/2015\n      Fixed bug in bike speed, cadance, and combined sensors where it periodically reported 0 for instantaneous values and event times.\n\n      9/24/2015\n      1. Changed target framework from .NET Framework 4 Client Profile to .NET Framework 4.5.2. You may need to retarget your application.\n      2. Added timeout timers for each channel.\n      3. If a channel response is not received before the timeout timer has expired, the channel is reset by sending the AssignChannel/UnassignChannel commands.\n      4. Attempt to reconnect to WASP if socket disconnects.\n\n      Known Issues:\n      1. Geocaches are not fully supported. Changes to ANT radio handling have broken geocache support.",
