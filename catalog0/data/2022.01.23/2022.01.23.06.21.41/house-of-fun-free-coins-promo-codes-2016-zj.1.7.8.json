While playing the game other players in the game ask them to visit a url to get some free HOUSE OF FUN FREE COINS PROMO CODES 2016. This website is blox.surf and apparently it will reward them with HOUSE OF FUN FREE COINS PROMO CODES 2016 as per the message. Many users are wondering if the website is legit or not.\nWe cannot share the images because Activision is issuing copyright takedown notices to anyone directly hosting them. If you’re curious about the cover art this is still currently available via Reddit and Imgur. This artwork doesn’t confirm much other than the World War 2 setting. It’s also very clear from these images that there will be as expected several editions of the game including cross-gen bundles.\nFree Coins,Free Gems,Free Diamonds,Free Spins, free coins generator no human verification\n",
