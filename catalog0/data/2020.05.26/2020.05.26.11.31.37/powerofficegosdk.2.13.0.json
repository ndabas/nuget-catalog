The employee hourly rates and cost is now replaced with a collection with a valid from date instead of single properties:\n      - New class EmployeeTimeHourlyRates added, and an IEnumerable of EmployeeTimeHourlyRates is added to the Employee object. To alter the hourly rate and/or hourly cost of an employee either edit the current EmployeeHourlyRates in the collection, or add a new EmployeeHourlyRates with a new ValidFromDate these rates should be valid from, and run a Save (POST) of the Employee object.\n      - HourlyRate and HourlyCost on Employee is now marked as Obsolete.

When saving a new API object with ExternalImportReference provided, PowerOffice Go checks if there is already an object of the same type and equal reference already saved. If the object already exists, PowerOffice Go throws an exception and does not save the provided API object. API objects that now have ExternalImportReference are:\n      - BankTransfer\n      - JournalEntryVoucher\n      - OutgoingInvoice\n      - All objects extending Voucher (BankJournalVoucher, CashJournalVoucher, ExpenseVoucher, IncomingInvoiceVoucher, ManualJournalVoucher, OutgoingInvoiceVoucher, PayrollJournalVoucher and YearEndJournalVoucher)\n      It is also possible to query vouchers or accounting entries by ExternalImportReference in the reports:\n      - InvoiceJournal\n      - AccountTransaction\n      - CustomerLedger\n      - SupplierLedger\n\n      Other changes:\n      - New Service: VoucherDocumentationService that can be used to retrieve voucher documentation and add documentation to an imported voucher.\n      - OutgoingInvoice and OutgoingInvoiceListItem: Added ContactGroupId and ContactGroup.\n      - Project: Added FixedPrice and BillableRate.\n      - DebtCollectionCase: Added InvoiceLastChanged.\n      - DebtCollectionInvoice: Added LastReminderEmailAddress and InvoiceEmailAddress.\n      - SalaryLine: Added CarRegistrationNo.\n      - Customer: Added ReminderEmailAddress and TransferToDebtCollectionAgency.\n      - ContactGroupService: Added methods GetCustomers, GetEmployees and GetSuppliers that can be used to query all Customers/Employees/Suppliers that are added to a specific ContactGroup.\n      - VatCode: Added ValidFrom and ValidTo.\n      - Voucher: Added HasImportedDocumentation added to base class Voucher. This property is set to true if the voucher is imported and has documentation added by the new VoucherDocumentationService.\n\n      2.6.2:\n      Project's budget was reworked in PowerOffice Go, leading to some breaking changes on Project in the API:\n      -BudgetedRevenueBillableExpenses no longer exist on the server side.
