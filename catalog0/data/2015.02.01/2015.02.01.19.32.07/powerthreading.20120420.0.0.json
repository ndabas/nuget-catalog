  "description": "Wintellect's own Jeffrey Richter has produced the Power Threading library (DLL) containing many classes to help with threading and asynchronous programming. \n\nThere are versions of the library for the .NET Framework, Silverlight, and the .NET Compact Framework.\n\nJeffrey has described many of the classes contained in the library by way of his MSDN Magazine Concurrent Affairs columns. \n\nThe library also contains some non-threading related classes for working with exceptions, command-line parsing, and more. \n\nWhen you download it, please read the enclosed End User License Agreement (EULA) before using the library in your own projects. \n\nFor limited support, questions, and comments, Jeffrey Richter has set up a Yahoo new group:\n\nGroup link: http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/PowerThreading/\n\nPost message: PowerThreading@YahooGroups.com \n\nSubscribe: PowerThreading-subscribe@YahooGroups.com \n\nUnsubscribe: PowerThreading-unsubscribe@YahooGroups.com \n\nTo purchase extended support, please contact Wintellect.",
