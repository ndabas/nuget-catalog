  "releaseNotes": "Hey everyone! This is one of the larger small updates, and I'm pretty proud of what I got done in a week.\n\nAlong with adding setters to parts like `Float3.XY` and fixing a few bugs, almost all improvements in this update are related to matricies. First of all, I've added a bunch of new items to the `IMatrix` interface. Now, any deriving matrix has more requirements that fit the regular `Matrix` type. I don't know why one would use the `IMatrix` interface rather than a specific matrix type, but now the options are more sophisticated.\n\nI've added some new stuff to all the matrix types, including row operations. You can now scale a row, add a row to another, and swap two rows. If I become aware of any more commonly-used row operations, I'll add then in a `2.4.2` update. But I think I've got all the good ones. There is also a mutable version of each operation which, rather than returning a new matrix with changes made, instead applies the changes to itself.\n\nDid you know I made two seperate blunders in the `Cofactor()` method? For the `Matrix2x2` version of the `Cofactor()` method, I had the diagonal elements swapped. Whoops. For the `Matrix` version of the `Cofactor()` method, matricies with even column count would break because of the alternating sign pattern I was using. Now, as far as I know, that bug is fixed.\n\nThe last thing I did was add the ability to turn a matrix into its equivalent row-echelon form. This is applicable only to the `Matrix` type (the dynamic one), and works with some levels of success. It's a little weird and tends to give results with lots of negative zeroes, but overall it's fine, I think. As far as I know there aren't any obvious bugs. We'll see though.\n\nAnyway, that's everything in this update. Again, pretty small, but meaningful nonetheless. Unless I haven't screwed anything up, the next update I work on will be `2.5`, so I'll see you then!",
