  "releaseNotes": "This release includes the core .NET libraries described below for implementing OData clients and services that comply with the Committee Specification 02 of the OASIS OData V4 Specification (http://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/odata/v4.0/cs02/part1-protocol/odata-v4.0-cs02-part1-protocol.doc). The libraries support the OData V4 JSON (http://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/odata-json-format/v4.0/cs02/odata-json-format-v4.0-cs02.doc) format; the Atom format is not supported in this release. \n\nWhat is in the release? \n\n•        Feature Parity \nThis release supports the same set of features that were supported in version 5.6.0 of the OData core libraries. This release supports OData v4 only and is not backwards compatible with OData versions 1-3. \n\n•        Enum support \nThe core libraries now have support for serializing and deserializing enum values in JSON payloads. The URI parser is able to parse enum values and operations including ‘has’.\n\n•        Singleton support\nThe core libraries now have support for serializing and deserializing singleton values in JSON payloads. The URI parser is now able to parse singletons in paths.\n\n•        Containment support \nThe core libraries now have support for serializing and deserializing contained values in JSON payloads. The URI parser is now able to parse contained paths.\n\n•        Function Support \nThe URI parser is now able to parse functions and function parameters in URLs. \n\n•        OData v4 compatibility \nThe JSON format, $metadata format and URI parser have all been updated to support OData v4. \n\nKnown Limitations \n* This release of the OData core libraries targets functional equivalence with the 5.6.0 release as well as support for a few new features. This means that there are many new OData v4 features that are not supported yet in the core libraries.\n• Although the OData core libraries are capable of serializing the OData v4 Atom format, this functionality is not officially supported since the Atom specification has not yet made it to the CS02 stage.",
