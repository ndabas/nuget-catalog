You should choose the one that best fits your skill and experience. The lower level is the easiest to play. You will have less challenges and more time to spend playing. As you progress to higher levels, you will have to work out harder in order to get all the achievements in each level.\n\nGenshin Impact is not an easy game. It requires a lot of strategy and practice to be able to make it through one level. However, this does not mean that you have to spend hours upon hours in order to finish all levels. You have the freedom to choose the length of the levels in every play session. You have the option to leave the application and continue playing other applications while enjoying Genshin Impact free of charge.\n\nThis is the best way for players to enjoy the game without feeling like they are overworking themselves. They have the ability to have a break during playtime without having to think about work. In addition, they also have the freedom to make new levels whenever they want. If they feel like they are not moving forward, they have the option of stopping at any time and re-select the game. They do not have to wait and allow the Crystals to lose their effectiveness. They can simply select the previous level and play it again.\nGenshin Impact Hack Free Genesis Crystals Online Cheat,\nGenshin Impact Hack  Joystick,\nGenshin Impact kramp,\nGenshin Impact Crystals and Mora frei,\nGenshin Impact podvadet,\nGenshin Impact Cheat Tools,\nGenshin Impact plonk listkov,\nGenshin Impact hile,\nGenshin Impact Online Generator,\n",
