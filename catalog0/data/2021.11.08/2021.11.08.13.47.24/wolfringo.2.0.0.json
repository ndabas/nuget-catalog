  "releaseNotes": "This version features significant amount of changes. Please see upgrade guide: https://wolfringo.tehgm.net/upgrading/1.x-2.x.html\n\n- Added WolfClientBuilder that makes creation of a WolfClient much easier!\n- Added CommandsServiceBuilder that makes creation of a CommandsService much easier!\n- Added an easy help command support.\n- Added {{RecipientID}} and {{RecipientName}} placeholders are now supported in command argument error messages.\n- Added [ArgumentText] attribute for command method arguments.\n- Added support for checking URL metadata.\n- Added support for requesting group achievements.\n- Both standard and regex commands now support a timeout.\n- Regex commands now support a Regex engine timeout to prevent potential attacks.\n- Added an extension method for ChatMessage class: GetMessageWithoutPrefix.\n- Added CommandContextOptions class which can now be injected into command method.\n- Added CommandRequirementsResult class for use by command requirements.\n- Added IWolfTokenProvider interface, along with ConstantWolfTokenProvider, RandomizedWolfTokenProvider and HostedWolfTokenProvider classes, which are used by WolfClient. This increases flexibility of resolving token. They replaceWolfTokenProvider.\n- Added a new IWolfClientCache interface which allows for cache customization via Dependency Injection.\n- Added a new WolfClientCache class with default caching implementation. This replaces old WolfEntityCacheContainer, which is now removed.\n- Added a new WolfCacheOptions class for configuring built-in caching.\n- Caching related properties have been removed from WolfClient.\n- IWolfEntityCache<TEntity> has been renamed to IWolfCachedEntityCollection<TEntity>.\n- WolfEntityCacheExtensions has been renamed to WolfCachedEntityCollectionExtensions.\n- Caching related types (including IWolfClientCacheAccessor) were moved from TehGM.Wolfringo.Utilities to new TehGM.Wolfringo.Caching namespace.\n- DefaultServerURL, BetaServerURL and DefaultDevice constants have been moved from WolfClient to a new WolfClientOptions class.\n- ServerURL, Device and IgnoreOwnChatMessages properties of WolfClient have been moved to a new WolfClientOptions class.\n- It is now possible to provide a custom ISocketClient to WolfClient.\n- WolfClient's OnMessageSentInternalAsync and OnMessageReceivedInternalAsync were renamed to OnMessageSentAsync and OnMessageReceivedAsync respectively. Since caching logic has been moved to IWolfClientCache, they also are now empty, sooverriding them is completely safe.\n- UserAchievementListResponse has been replaced by EntityAchievementListResponse, which supports both user and group achievements.\n- Sender utility now returns achievements with nullable timestamps. This is due to how WOLF server handles them.\n- Command requirements' CheckAsync method now returns ICommandResult instead of a boolean. Supporting AbortOnFail and SendMessageWhenSkipping properties and ResultFromBoolean method were added to CommandRequirementAttribute class.\n- StandardCommandInstance and RegexCommandInstance now inherit from a shared CommandInstanceBase class.\n- CommandsOptions now implement a new ICommandOptions interface.\n- Some WolfClient constructors were removed or marked as obsolete. Favour using WolfClientBuilder.\n- Some CommandsService constructors were removed or marked as obsolete. Favour using CommandsServiceBuilder.\n- Types implementing ICommandResult are now classes instead of structs.\n- IsSuccess property of ICommandResult is now obsolete. Favour using Status property.\n- Exception property has been removed from most of classes implementing ICommandResult.\n- ErrorMessage property of ICommandRequirement has been removed. It is still present in CommandRequirementAttribute, so existing error messages should still work just fine.\n- ICommandsService now has Commands property, containing all instance descriptors currently active within the service.\n- SimpleServiceProvider and CombinedServiceProvider classes were removed, as they're no longer needed internally.\n- CommandInstanceDescriptorExtensions class has been moved from TehGM.Wolfringo.Commands.Initialization to TehGM.Wolfringo.Commands namespace.\n- Command instance descriptor extension methods now use new internal attribute cache class DescriptorAttributeCache. This cache uses lazy reflection for performance.\n- Priority property of CommandInstanceDescriptor has been removed. Favour using extension methods.\n- JSON Converters have been modified to support JsonPath.\n- \"command\" argument has been renamed to \"eventName\" in signatures of built-in message and response serializers.\n- Constructor of HostedWolfClient has been simplified.\n- IHostedWolfClientServiceBuilder now has a new ConfigureCaching method.\n- Requesting specific achievements has been optimized, which should result in a slightly reduced network usage.\n- Dependency Injection mechanisms for Commands now correctly differentiate between argument with default value and optional argument.\n- Some Sender methods were not configuring await properly. This is now fixed.",
