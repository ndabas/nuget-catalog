The Metadata would not be instance specific.\n                    \n            Streamlined .Clone support by removing unneeded WhoAmI validation call.\n            Added new .Clone override to allow a developer to pass an assembly reference to the .Clone method to use when establishing strong types for that connection.\n            Added addition error log details when a fault is detected\n            Added settings to control inline retry of requests when request is failed due to a network related issue.\n            ApiOperationRetryCountOverride - count of retries before the connection gives up.  default is 3.\n            ApiOperationRetryDelayOverride - Time the system waits between retries in seconds.  default is 1. \n        \n        9.0.2.4:\n            Added support for retrying SDK request if the server throws a retriable errors.\n            Global Discovery is now preferred for all commercial regions as part of logon. \n                This will remove the \"Screen pops\" that chain pop when choosing \"Don’t Know\" for your region.\n\n        9.0.2.3:  \n            Updated with Xrm.Tooling.Connector support - See Notes for this module for details. \n            Added support for Skiping discovery using an app.config app setting entry called \"SkipDiscovery\" with a value of True \n                Note: This will require you to enter the base URL of the instance your trying to connect to. \n                    Applies to Online Connections only. \n                    Intended for Microsoft Use only. Documented here for troubleshooting support when required.\n\n        9.0.0.7: Fixed to allow External Authentication Type to function in released versions of Xrm.Tooling.Connector.dll\n        9.0.0.5: 9.0 Initial Release\n        9.0.0.2-preview: \n            Improved cache system for faster reconnects.\n            New interfaces to support certificate based auth.\n            Added support to skip discovery\n            Added Clone connection support of OAuth based connections\n            Added New Authentication type to support externally hosted auth. \n           **Note: Interface for Xrm.Tooling.Connector is *NOT* Final. there are new API interfaces that will be surfaced before GA.\n\n        8.2.0.5:\n            Fix to memory leak in Microsoft.Xrm.Tooling.Connector.TraceLoggerBase.  Trace Listener collection would not be released within a process over a very long time frame over multiple connections. This would manifest as increasing memory consumption over a very long period. \n            Fix cleans this up on the .dispose() call on the CrmServiceClient. \n            Note: if you have built your own logger based on the Microsoft.Xrm.Tooling.Connector.TraceLoggerBase, you must call .dispose() when you are done with it to clean up the listener collection assigned to it.\n\n        8.2.0.4: Added Support for United Kingdom CRM GEO\n        8.2.0.2: Fix of dependency issue in nuget package. Now properly requires .net 4.5.2 as a baseline\n        8.2.0.1: Assembly version changed to 2.2.0.0\n            Fixes: \n            Many Accessibility fixes for screen readers.\n            Added:\n            New Function: CultureUtils.SetDisplayCulture(LCID),  This function provides support to relay out the UX based on localization needs ( RTL support ) \n\n        8.1.0: CRM Online 2016 Update 1\n        8.0.2: UR1 (Update Rollup 1)\n        8.0.0: RTM",
