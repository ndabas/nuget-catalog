  "description": "Code Effects is one of the fastest business rules engines that allows creation, modification, validation and evaluation of complex business rules, as well as creation and execution of complex rule-based data filters for virtually all established LINQ providers. Using its web interface, business users can create rules or filters by selecting options from a series of context-sensitive drop-down menus. This IntelliSense-like approach is unique to web-based business rule management. With Code Effects integrated into your project, the most complex business rules can be authored without any knowledge of programming languages. Detailed documentation can be found at CodeEffects.com/Doc",
