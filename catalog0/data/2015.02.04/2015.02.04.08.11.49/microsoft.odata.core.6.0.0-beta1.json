  "releaseNotes": "This OData V6.0 release includes beta versions of the core .NET libraries described below for implementing OData clients and services that comply with the Committee Specification 02 of the OASIS OData V4 Specification (http://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/odata/v4.0/cs02/part1-protocol/odata-v4.0-cs02-part1-protocol.doc). The libraries support the OData V4 JSON (http://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/odata-json-format/v4.0/cs02/odata-json-format-v4.0-cs02.doc) format; the Atom format is not supported in this release.\n\nWhat is in the release?\n \n•         Feature Parity\nOData V6.0-beta1 release contains all the JSON features in OData V5.6 release that are compatible with OData V4 Protocol, including ODataLib, EdmLib, ODataClient, Spatial. OData V6.0-beta1 supports V4 Protocol only and is not backward compatible with V1-3 Protocol.\n\n•         Enum support\nEnum is fully supported for server scenario in JSON. OData client supports CRUD enum property.\n \n•         Singleton support\nIn this release we get the most common singleton support for server scenario, including defining singleton in EDM, and serializing/deserializing payload in JSON format. UriParser also supports singleton path segment in URI, but it doesn’t support $filter/$select/$expand.\n\n•         Containment support\nIn this release we get the most common containment support for server scenario, including defining containment in EDM, and serializing/ deserializing payload in JSON format. UriParser also supports containment path segment & $expand in URI, but it doesn’t support $filter/$orderby/$select.\n\n•         Action/Function Support\nAction/Function now is now fully supported, except for singleton & containment.\n \n•         V4 compatibility\nJSON Reader/Writer, Edmx Reader/Writer and URI Parser have been updated for V4 compatibility, now they all support OData V4 Protocol.\n\nKnown Limitations\nThis beta release of the OData V4 libraries targets functional equivalence with the 5.6.0 release. The OData Client supports the functionality exposed by services written using the server libraries, but there are features required for client interoperability with generic OData V4 services that are not yet supported in this alpha release. Most notably:\n•\tEdmLib doesn't currently support TypeDefinitions, nor referencing external metadata documents, and will fail on services exposing metadata with these constructs\n•\tODataLib doesn't currently support the presence of singletons, functions, or nested service documents in a service document, and will fail when reading a service document containing these constructs\n•\tODataLib, EdmLib, and OData Client don't yet support the Date or TimeOfDay datatype, relative IRIs for IDs in JSON, some of the new features of complex types like navigation properties, inheritance, and use in referential constraints, nor some of the new features in singletons and containment.",
