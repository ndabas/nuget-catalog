  "releaseNotes": "This package contains assemblies for Dynamics 365 (online and on-premises). These assemblies require application development using the Microsoft .NET Framework 4.6.2 or later.\n\n9.1.0.46:\n          Corrected an issue with CMT lookup resolution that would prefer the display name over the ID of the target of the lookup.\n          Corrected an issue with CMT where a failure to import would occur if, during the decision process for update vs insert, an existing record was not found by ID and the Name field of the record was null\n          This would only impact default search patterns.  Entities that defined custom search's would not be impacted.\n\n\n          9.1.0.44:\n          Fixed an issue with Batch mode import that is caused by invalid guid's being hand edited into datafiles.\n          Fixed an issue where CMT would prefer ID/Name over comparison keys when precaching data for comparison.\n\n          9.1.0.43:\n          Fix in Data import to compensate for Import files created during a window of time where new virtual fields generated by CDS were incorrectly identified as valid fields.\n          This issue would cause schema validation to fail during import of complex data for some types of \"attributeOf\" type fields.\n\n          9.1.0.40:\n          Fixed a bug in runtime settings parsing that would mis identify a = in the value as a key value separator.\n\n          9.1.0.39:\n          Fixed an issue where data import could hang without error\n\n          9.1.0.37:\n          Fix for an issue where importing business units that included a lookup for their own team (looped back to the entity) would not be populated on update.\n          Fixed a general issue were related LookUp ID's that were discovered in the target system were not properly linked.\n          Behavior Change: when using BatchMode, Create will always include the ID of the record from the source system, even if not explicitly included as a field in the exported system.\n\n          9.1.0.36:\n          Fix for an issue reported where related objects were not being correctly identified by name and thus not correctly linked to importing records\n          This only impacted imports where the related entity did not have comparison keys\n\n          9.0.1.33:\n          Altering the default client engine to move coreobjects to a non static type,\n          Staging for merger of MTPD code with mainline PD.\n          Added in memory configuration parsing logic\n          Optimized dependency checking logic\n\n          9.1.0.27:\n          Cleaned up extra lines in logging output.\n          Adding Logging for time taken during configuraiton parsing to aid in performance info.\n          Uptook New CDS SDK drop.\n\n          9.1.0.24:\n          Fixed an issue preventing logs from being generated correctly,  Logs should once again write to the log directory\n\n          9.1.0.21:\n          Many Logging improvements\n          Fixed an issue with Async Solution Import.\n          Includes fixes from DMT: Fixed bug with preprocessing that would cause an apparent runaway, removed check for display name on attributes, updated batch mode system.\n\n          9.1.0.20:\n          Introduced binding redirect for Microsoft.IdentityModel.Clients.ActiveDirectory dll.\n          Package developers can define error type as application error or publisher error - internal only.\n\n          9.0.2.30:\n          Enhanced PD logs and temporary file delete logic.\n\n          9.0.2.29:\n          Enhanced PD logs and raise fail event immediately when AfterPackageImport returns fail.\n\n          9.0.2.26:\n          Enhanced PD to pass more error details to invoker of PD lib\n\n          9.0.2.24:\n          Published PackaDeployerException class which can be used by package developers\n          Enhanced PD to bubble up error details to invoker of PD lib with progress status in case of failure - internal only\n\n          9.0.2.23:\n          Internal updates - No Public changes\n\n          9.0.2.22:\n          Internal updates - No Public changes\n\n          9.0.2.21:\n          Logging updates for async import error scenario.\n\n          9.0.2.20:\n          Logging Updates\n          Added support for default async mode for DeleteAndPromote, regardless of how a given package is configured.\n          Reverted change for RaiseFail event which done in version 9.0.2.19.  Now it will not cause PD to stop with an overall failure and stick to old behavior of continuing package installation.\n\n          9.0.2.19:\n          Logging Updates\n          Added support for forcing all packages to run Sync mode, regardless of how a given package is configured.\n          Modified RaiseFail event for RaiseFail generated from the package.  New behavior will cause PD to stop with an overall failure.\n\n          9.0.2.16:\n          Added native support for handing throttling messages from server.\n          Improved handling of retry logic for blocked imports due to concurrent metadata import\n\n          9.0.2.14:\n          Corrected an error that occurs when a Async Upgrade Fails due to a recoverable server issue.  PD will attempt to recovery correctly vs aborting and requiring a restart.\n\n          9.0.2.12:\n          Correcting Dependancy Info on Package\n          Fixed bug in CrmServiceClient which would cause some OnPrem connections to fail with an error \"Item already added to List\"\n          Minor Pref Improvements\n\n          9.0.2.11:\n          Updated to include Fixed version of CrmServiceClient and login control for new US Geo ( US Gov High )\n          Added support for Preferring Affinity with a given node to improve cache hit success rate.\n\n          9.0.2.9:\n          Note .net 4.6.2 is now required as a baseline\n          Fixed a user reported issue that would cause an import patch to fail due to being misapplied.\n          Fixed a user reported issue that would cause the incorrect version of a solution to be imported under some circumstances during update.\n          Added better error detection for failed Async Jobs when using Async Solution Import.\n          Major updates to error logging to make logs more concise and useful.\n\n          9.0.2.8:\n          Corrected an issue which would occur while importing a package that contained an upgrade for a deployed solution, where a prior version upgrade had failed leaving a holding solution. The system will now attempt to apply the current holding solution, and upon success, apply the new upgrade contained.\n\n          9.0.2.7:\n          Picked up updated CrmServiceClient (Microsoft.Xrm.Tooling.Connector)\n\n\n          9.0.2.5:\n          Corrected use of strong types inside Package Deployer to allow it to work properly with packages that also include overlapping strong typed objects.\n          Corrected a case where Async Solution Deployment could fail and not be correctly caught by PD.\n\n          9.0.2.4:\n          Updated install flows to more correctly trigger failures on failures within user code or data import.\n          Added support several configuration settings dealing with timeouts and dials.\n          Thease settings are set in the app.config of the host process\n          StaleImportProgressOverride -\n          This setting is the number of times a solution import be polled for progress.
