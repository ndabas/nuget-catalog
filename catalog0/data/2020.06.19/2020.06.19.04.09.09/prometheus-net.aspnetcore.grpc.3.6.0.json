  "releaseNotes": "* 3.6.0\n- Added ASP.NET Core health check publisher for publishing metrics on health check status. #203 #209\n- Fixed hang in ASP.NET Web API exporter. #215\n- Fixed ASP.NET Web API exporter exporting metrics from the wrong registry. #217\n- Reduced memory use in MetricPusher implementation. Inspired by #208\n- Added basic gRPC service metrics support. #212\n- Reduce pointless log spam on cancelled scrapes - will silently ignore cancelled scrapes in the ASP.NET Core exporter. #220\n* 3.5.0\n- Exposed metric.Unpublish() method since there was already a matching Publish() there.\n- When the scrape is aborted, stop collecting/serializing metrics. #189\n- Added simple metric export handler for legacy ASP.NET Web API, to avoid having to deal with HttpListener complexity.\n* 3.4.0\n- Separate packaging for ASP.NET Core 3 to reduce package reference management complexity for users. #164\n- Lazy-initialize the default sample metrics to reduce initialization cost for those who do not need them. #170\n- ASP.NET Core middlware no longer disposes of output stream. #171\n- Fix DotNetStats occasional data tearing under parallel collections. #173\n- Improved wording of some error messages. #169\n- Added Counter.IncTo(), Gauge.IncTo(), Gauge.DecTo(). #181\n- Added Gauge.Set(DateTimeOffset) and Gauge.IncTo(DateTimeOffset). #181\n- Improve .NET Framework 4.6.1 packaging to include the ValueTuple reference automatically. #179\n- ASP.NET Core HTTP metrics now capture route data before it is overwritten by an exception handler. #177\n- ASP.NET Core HTTP \"in progress\" metrics now include controller/action labels (ASP.NET Core 3 only).\n- Fixed concurrently defect in HTTP metrics that may have caused label values from wrong request to apply. #182\n- The HttpListener based MetricServer can now handle more than one concurrent request.\n- Added asynchronous \"before collect\" callbacks, giving user code more flexibility in metric updates.\n- Added .Remove() to labeled metric instances for more convenient removal API (previously had to call method on parent instance).\n- Added .Unpublish() to labeled metric instances to support temporary unpublishing of a metric, without discarding collected data (e.g. histogram buckets), during periods of data unavailability.\n* 3.3.0\n- Add ability to filter requests by port number when exporting metrics. #160\n* 3.2.1\n- Fix NuGet packaging defect that caused reference failures after installing .2.0 on .NET Core 2.1 or newer. #158\n* 3.2.0\n- Enable custom HTTP client to be used in MetricPusher, allowing for Basic auth and more flexibility. #125\n- Add DiagnosticSourceAdapter (.NET Core only). #153\n- Improved compatibility with older .NET Framework versions. #155\n* 3.1.4\n- Fix timezone mismatch in Summary that led to unintended delays in buffer flushing. #149\n* 3.1.3\n- Fix regression introduced in 3.1.0 where MetricPusher does not always flush metrics before stopping.\n* 3.1.2\n- Fix defect where Histogram batch observations only incremented sum by one value, instead of entire batch. #147\n* 3.1.1\n- Added missing UTF-8 charset to Content-Type header, so non-ASCII characters are interpreted correctly by browsers.\n* 3.1.0\n- Added ICounter.NewTimer() (adds the value to the counter)\n- Eliminated some needless allocations when trying to register a metric that is already registered. #134\n- Added IHistogram.Count and IHistogram.Sum to expose aspects of collected data for inspection.\n- Added Collector.GetAllLabelValues() to expose the list of child metrics by all their known label values.\n- Metric export is now asynchronous internally to be compatible with ASP.NET Core 3.0 default configuration.\n- Added CollectorRegistry.CollectAndExportAsTextAsync() to support metric data export via arbitrary custom endpoints.\n* 3.0.3\n- Now backward compatible with ASP.NET Core 2.1 (was 2.2+)\n* 3.0.2\n- Fix defect where histogram sum failed to increment.\n* 3.0.1\n- Fix ObjectDisposedException in MetricPusher.\n* 3.0.0\n- Added HTTP request metrics for ASP.NET Core.\n- Somewhat more realistic examples in readme.\n- Metrics exporter is now significantly more CPU and memory-efficient.\n- Added Observe(value, count) to histogram metric, enabling multiple observations with the same value to be counted.\n- Added CountExceptions() and MeasureInProgress() helper extensions.\n- Adjusted API to better conform to Prometheus client library guidelines in terms of default values.\n- Breaking change: assemblies are now strong-named.\n- Breaking change: removed \"windows\" from built-in metric names as they are not Windows-specific.\n- Breaking change: removed support for protobuf export format (it is no longer used by Prometheus).\n- Breaking change: API surface cleaned up, removed some legacy methods, made many internal types actually internal.\n- Breaking change: \"on demand collectors\" concept replaced with simpler \"before collect callbacks\". Works the same, just less code needed to use it and fewer possible error conditions.\n- Breaking change: removed support for \"custom collectors\", as this was a very special use case that did not benefit at all from the main functionality of the library. Just generate a Prometheus exporter output document yourself if you need to export arbitrary data.\n* 2.1.3\n- Fixed wrong case used for metric type in the export data format. Should always be lowercase. #96\n* 2.1.2\n- Fixed potential conflict when using pushgateway and also other exporter libraries (see #89)\n* 2.1.1\n- Various minor fixes (see issues on GitHub for details).\n* 2.1.0\n- Add MetricOptions and subclasses for more extensible API (old API surface remains available)\n- Add SuppressInitialValue to metric configuration (ref https://www.robustperception.io/existential-issues-with-metrics/)\n- Add .WithLabels() as alternative to .Labels() for fewer annoying Intellisense conflicts.\n* 2.0.0\n- Targeting .NET Standard 2.0 as minimum version (.NET Framework 4.6.1, .NET Core 2.0 and Mono 5.4)\n- Added ASP.NET Core middlware\n- Added possibility to signal a failed scrape from on-demand collectors\n- Removed dependency on Reactive Extensions\n- Minor breaking changes to API\n- Performance improvements for hot-path code\n- Removed mostly obsolete PerfCounterCollector class\n- Fixed NuGet package contents to remove assemblies from dependencies\n- Various minor fixes (see issues on GitHub for details)\n* 1.3.4\n- Added support for .NET 4.5 using System.Reactive 3.1.1.\n- .NET 4.0 support continues to target Rx 2.5\n* 1.2.4:\n- Fixed MetricPusher not flushing metrics when stopped\n* 1.2.3:\n- Fixed label values escaping for ASCII formatter\n* 1.2.2:\n- PushGateway support\n- Various internal improvements (replaced locks with Interlocked operations)    \n* 1.1.4:\n- Fixed some metrics not updating, added process ID metric\n- Replaced lock statements in Counter and Gauge with CAS\n* 1.1.3:\n- optionally use https in MetricServer\n* 1.1.2:\n- using UTF-8 in text formatter\n- catching exceptions in MetricServer http loop\n* 1.1.1:\n- disposing of MetricServer loop on Stop()\n* 1.1.0:\n- Renamed some metric names to be in-line with prometheus guidelines (breaking change as far as the exported metrics are concerned)\n* 1.0.0:\n- Add CPU, num handles, start time, num threads metrics to dot net stats collector\n- Made DotNetStatsCollector default (previously it was PerfCounterCollector)\n* 0.0.11:\n- Summary metric ported from go\n* 0.0.10:\n- Fix header writing order\n* 0.0.9:\n- Generalise scraping so it can be called externally without using the embedded http handler\n* 0.0.8:\n- Introduced interfaces for all the metrics to make unlabelled collectors and their children polymorph\n* 0.0.7:\n- Added the notion of OnDemandCollectors + a DotNetStatsCollector to avoid having to use .net perf counters\n* 0.0.6:\n- Do not create unlabelled metric if label names are specified\n* 0.0.5:\n- Allow specifying hostname in URL\n- Fix null ref exception if 'Accept' header is not specified\n* 0.0.3 - initial version",
