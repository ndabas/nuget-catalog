One of these new games is a brand new game that was just released. The other is a former PSP exclusive that has finally come to Xbox platforms. That said, as always, it's unclear how long either game has been added, meaning we don't know how long you have to play it. \n\nThe first of the two games is Nobody Saves the World, the latest game from Drinkbox Studios, the developer best known for the Guacamelee! series.
