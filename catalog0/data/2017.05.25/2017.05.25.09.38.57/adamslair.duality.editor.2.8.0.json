  "releaseNotes": "PackageManager Verify Bugfix, PackageUpdateSchedule Bugfix, PackageManager Verify Optimization\n#FIX: Restored original package verification behavior where every package was installed, as there may be cases where a local setup item matches exactly with its installation, but its dependencies do not.\n#FIX: Fixed an exception when applying updater changes.\n#CHANGE: Skipping full package verification for packages where the specified setup and local repository are already a version-specific match.\n#CHANGE: Removed an extra layer of log indentation for verifying packages.\n#CHANGE: Added a clarifying comment to some of the package sync code on editor startup.\n#CHANGE: Added try-finally guard clauses around log indentation sections, so they're properly un-indented in case of an exception.\n#CHANGE: Rephrased editor package sync logs to better reflect what is actually happening.\n#CHANGE: PackageCache now operates exclusively on a remote repository and doesn't fall back to retrieving local packages.\n#FIX: Fixed package environment default to use relative paths instead of rooted / absolute paths.\n#FIX: Fixed a bug in startup cancellation code that would prevent Duality from shutting down when intending to do so.\n#FIX: Fixed a first-install bug in the package manager caused by using PathOp core functionality that only becomes available after the system backend has been initialized.\n#CHANGE: Adjusted archived editor logfile names to include seconds in their timestamp to avoid overwriting them when restarting.\n#CHANGE: Moved view-specific package version display code to PackageViewDialog.\n#CHANGE: Cleaned up some code in PackageManager, moved around most of it. \n#ADD: Added XML docs to public PackageManager API.\n#CHANGE: Extracted internal package info cache from PackageManager. \n#CHANGE: Changed default behavior to also cache remote repository data that may change (like new packages becoming available), but allowing to clear the cache manually when desired. \n#CHANGE: Renamed public PackageManager API for enumerating available packages and retrieving package info.\n#FIX: Fixed null reference exception in PackageName.GetHashCode for version-invariant names.\n#CHANGE: Code style tweaks, internal variable renamed.\n#CHANGE: Extracted the PackageDependencyWalker algorithm from its previous implementation in PackageManager internals. \n#CHANGE: Adjusted the implementation to produce less garbage and perform faster due to a persistent package resolve cache.\n#CHANGE: PackageInfo now uses read-only lists for authors, tags and dependencies.\n#CHANGE: Uninstalling a package with dependencies will now take into account which shared dependencies only exist due to transitivity over the uninstall candidate and treat them accordingly.\n#CHANGE: Replaced internal uninstall queue / lock with custom dependency resolve and uninstall rules.\n#CHANGE: Extended auto-uninstall of old package versions when installing a newer version of the same package to non-Duality packages as well.\n#ADD: Added XML comments to LocalPackage.\n#REMOVE: Removed LocalPackage.IsInstallationComplete property, as it was unused and did no longer serve a purpose.\n#FIX: Fixed an exception during the first install of a previously version-invariant package.\n#CHANGE: Moved around package sync coroutine.\n#CHANGE: Previous editor logfiles are now archived in the Temp subfolder and no longer limited to a single one. \n#CHANGE: Cleaned up editor startup routine by splitting it up into multiple methods.\n#CHANGE: Improved readability of stringified package names and event listener assertion messages.\n#CHANGE: When installing a package that is a newer version of an already-installed package, the old version will be uninstalled first.\n#CHANGE: The package managers internal uninstall queue for Duality packages is now off by default and only selectively enabled during an externally triggered uninstall operation.\n#CHANGE: The default plugin loader no longer logs warnings for unresolved Assemblies, if those Assemblies are (WinForms) Resource Assemblies.\n#ADD: Added more logs to PackageManager, including logs about NuGet internals for diagnostic purposes.\n#FIX: Fixed ApplyChanges failing when attempting to copy into a non-existent directory.\n#CHANGE: Exposed API to perform trivial update operations in the package update schedule immediately. Used for updater updates and testing.\n#ADD: Added Equals and equality operator support to PackageName.\n#FIX: Fixed package install not using the root directory as specified in the PackageManagerEnvironment.\n#FIX: Fixed a flaky path comparison in PackageUpdateSchedule to decide whether an item affects the updater tool.\n#CHANGE: Moved updater file path from an internal constant to PackageManagerEnvironment.\n#ADD: Added XML comments for PackageUpdateSchedule API.\n#ADD: Added XML comments for PackageManagerEnvironment API.\n#ADD: Added XML comments for PackageSetup API.\n#ADD: Added an abstraction leak to PakageUpdateSchedule allowing to access the scheduled update items directly, as this is probably the less maintenance-intensive way compared to introducing a while class hierarchy just for accessing them in tests only.\n#CHANGE: Replaced some hardcoded relative paths with proper PackageManagerEnvironment lookups.\n#CHANGE: Moved construction, serialization and partial application of package update schedules out of the PackageManager and into its own class.\n#ADD: Added GetPackage shortcut to the PackageSetup class and used it in PackageManager where manual LINQ lookups were used before.\n#CHANGE: Replaced the hardcoded LoadConfig / SaveConfig methods with a constructor fallback and the option to manually provide a pre-generated package setup class.\n#CHANGE: Moved all \"local paths / work environment\" related settings into the new PackageManagerEnvironment class.\n#CHANGE: Moved that is defined in the package config file into a separate class that also takes care of loading and saving it.",
