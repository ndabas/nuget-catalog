  "description": "Key features of PowerWebSockets include full-duplex high-speed channels optimized for pushing real time data to a large number of connections, integrated DEFLATE or LZF4 compression for minimizing payload size, TLS transport security with X.509 or username/password authentication, advanced keep-alive and disconnection detection, written in fully-managed C#, and many more.\n\n\tThe design of PowerWebSockets empowers both clients and servers with the same rich set of capabilities, enabling you to host services both on the server side and on the client side, as well as to make your services act as both a server and a client simultaneously.\n\n\tIn addition to the standard text and binary messaging, PowerWebSockets offers you an integrated JSON messaging framework which provides one way and request/response bidirectional operations, arbitrary length streaming, and easy interoperability between browser clients, mobile devices, desktops and servers on a wide variety of platforms.\n\n\tYou can use PowerWebSockets on .NET, CF, Xamarin or Mono enabled platforms such as Windows, Windows Phone, Windows CE, Azure, Xbox 360, Android, iOS, Linux and OS X.",
