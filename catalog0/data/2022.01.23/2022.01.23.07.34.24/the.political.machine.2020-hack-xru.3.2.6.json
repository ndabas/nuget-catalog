The court battle started last year when Apple removed Epic’s Fortnite from its App Store after the developer had engineered a system to prevent Apple from taking a 30 per cent commission on Fortnite sales to iPhone users. Epic’s defence was couched in the language of worry about how Apple’s behaviour could affect and shape an emerging Metaverse.\nOnce Mr. Rich is defeated you’ll need to take the Cyclops Eye to the wizard NPC in the cave. As long as you’ve already got the Generator ingredient off him you’ll get 20 Gems for free.\nOne other sale you have probably noticed is an item that can be purchased once and a player has access to it forever. A few examples could be access to a special area a power-up or an item for their avatar that connects back to the game.\nDuring a recent developer QA Splitgate developers announced that they are working on an update that will bring Splitgate to Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5. We don’t know much else at this point and there is no release window announced but we expect the Splitgate upgrade will have a smoother framerate than the Splitgate PS4 and Xbox One versions have currently. 1047 Games also mentioned possibilities of versions on Switch Mac and mobile but the studio hasn’t begun any work for such versions yet.\nThe Political Machine 2020 - The Political Machine 2020 GENERATOR\nThe prices for the items are all over the map and it is up to you to research similar designs to learn what they are going for in the catalog. It is a great way to make some extra Generator if this sounds like something you might be interested in doing.\n",
