  "releaseNotes": "This package contains assemblies for Dynamics 365 (online and on-premises). These assemblies require application development using the Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5.2 or later.\n\n          9.0.2.7: \n            Picked up updated CrmServiceClient (Microsoft.Xrm.Tooling.Connector)\n            Added new property for packages developers called CurrentPackageLocation. \n                This will provide the path to the drop location for your package assets directory to your package. \n\n\t\t  9.0.2.5:\n\t\t\tCorrected use of strong types inside Package Deployer to allow it to work properly with packages that also include overlapping strong typed objects.\n\t\t\tCorrected a case where Async Solution Deployment could fail and not be correctly caught by PD.\t\t  \n\t\t  \n          9.0.2.4:\n            Updated install flows to more correctly trigger failures on failures within user code or data import. \n          \n            Importconfig.xml - Solutions node updates. \n\t            Added requiredimportmode as an option to force an Async or Sync import behavior for a given solution. \n\t\t        This includes, upgrade or new install.\n\t\t        Valid settings for this property are : \n        \t\t\tasync -  Requires the Import of this solution to be done in an async manner if the server supports it. \n\t\t\t        sync - Requires the import of this solution to be done in a sync manner if the server supports it. \n                Default behavior follows the default setting for the Package Deployer Core Process. \n\n\n          9.0.2.3: \n            Updated with Xrm.Tooling.Connector support\n            Fixed issues that caused unhandled exceptions to be thrown when a package resulted in an error.\n            Added new notifications in logs and UX for faults (where applicable). \n            Added logic to detect stuck solution import and abort the import process\n\n \n          9.0.0.7: Fixed a bug in CMT Lookup processing logic that was causing incorrect linking where the data set includes records that require related lookup records which share the same default name.\n          9.0.0.5: 9.0 Initial Release\n          9.0.0.2-preview:\n          Updated for 9.x assemblies and Xrm.Tooling 3.x\n\n          8.2.0.4:\n          Fixes:\n          Addressed an issue where PD would fail to handle a previously failed upgrade, ending up getting stuck on trying to rerun upgrade on a solution that is already partly through the process.  New behavior will cause PD to recognize this state and attempt to complete the upgrade vs calling Import again.  Package developer note:  When this state occurs the upgrade action (RunSolutionUpgradeMigrationStep) call will NOT be called as its expected that this code would have run on the prior run that failed.\n\n          Added:\n          New package function: OverrideSolutionImportDecision support to override import decisions for individual solutions. This function will allow you to skip a solution or force it to update where PD would have skipped, other functions are limited at this time.\n\n          8.2.0.2: Fix of dependency issue in nuget package. Now properly requires .net 4.5.2 as a baseline\n          8.2.0.1: Assembly version changed to 2.2.0.0\n          Fixes:\n          When Logging provider is supplied, it is now being pushed to package log sinks.\n          Fixed support for using flat file import ( CRM native support ) on non-English organizations\n          Fixed an infinite wait loop that could occur if DeleteAndPromote call failed during upgrade to CRM with a Connection Timeout error.\n          Fixed an issue in the upgrade detection logic that incorrectly compared versions of source and target solution, under some conditions a newer version of the solution on import was incorrectly determined to be an older version causing it to be skipped.\n          Added Binding redirect logic to attempt to handle some versioning issue with supporting assemblies.\n\n          Added:\n          Support for new App.Config setting called  SuppressImportLog, when true will prevent the detailed log from being written to disk.\n\n          Capability notes, *important!:\n          The function PreSolutionImport(string solutionName, out bool overwriteUnmanagedCustomizations, out bool publishWorkflowsAndActivatePlugins); has been flagged as Obsolete and will no longer be called.\n          It has been REPLACED by the function:\n          PreSolutionImport(string solutionName, bool solutionOverwriteUnmanagedCustomizations, bool solutionPublishWorkflowsAndActivatePlugins, out bool overwriteUnmanagedCustomizations, out bool publishWorkflowsAndActivatePlugins);\n\n          8.1.0: CRM Online 2016 Update 1\n          8.1-preview: Pre-release CRM Online 2016 Update 1\n          8.0.2: UR1 (Update Rollup 1)\n          8.0.0: RTM",
