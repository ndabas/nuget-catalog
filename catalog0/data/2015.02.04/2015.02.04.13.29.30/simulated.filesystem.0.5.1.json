  "description": "This package provides a transactional view of a file system and an in-memory simulator for that view. This makes it easy to test code that interacts with the file system.\n\nThis is not your typical files and directories API. There is a single instance that represents the entire file system. File and directory objects are bound to a file system instance and all the instances related to a single file system share consistent state.\n\nWhole-system savepoints are built in and you can revert to the last savepoint at any time.",

  "releaseNotes": "Everything is performed async, with Tasks exposed to the user. Make sure you await operations.\n\t\n\t\tThis release also adds the ability to delete files and directories, still with full transactional gurantees.\n\n\t\tAPI is not yet locked but will be soon. At tht point, I will maintain backwards compatibility from there on. Future experimentation will happen in the Simulated.Experimental namespace. Everything outside of that namespace will be compatible.",
