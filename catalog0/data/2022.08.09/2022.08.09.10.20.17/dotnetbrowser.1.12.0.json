  "releaseNotes": "We are happy to announce availability of the new DotNetBrowser version. \nPlease find a detailed overview of the changes, introduced in v1.12:\n\nChromium 60\n\nThe Chromium engine was upgraded to version 60.0.3112.113. It means that support of WebGL 2.0 was automatically enabled.\n\nNew features:\nAbility to modify User-Agent string for the particular Browser instance at runtime. See example.\nAbility to change Accept-Language for the particular Browser instance at runtime. See example.\nAbility to convert JSObject to JSON string. See example.\n\nImprovements\nThe following features and areas function better in this version:\nThe on-screen keyboard support in Windows 10.\nSupport of custom cursors (WPF, Lightweight). The previous implementation created undesired temporary files in the working directory. Such behavior may have caused exceptions when the working directory is read-only.\nThe startup errors handling. Now the exceptions that may be thrown during startup will include more information about the root cause of the error.\nStability when loading Flash content after displaying a PDF file.\nStability when loading Flash content after displaying popups.\n\nFixed issues:\nThe WPFBrowserView.PreviewMouseWheel event now provides the scroll delta properly (WPF, Heavyweight). In the previous implementation, the received scroll delta was always set to 0.\nIssue with custom PopupHandler implementation being ignored and the default one being used when the WPFBrowserView control is hosted in the WinForms applications.\nUnnecessary focus grabbing when the StartLoadingFrameEvent event has been received (WPF, Heavyweight).\nIssue when it's not possible to access some properties of the IDictionary object injected into JavaScript through JS-.NET bridge API. For example, the previous implementation worked improperly with the Keys property.\nLosing keyboard focus after displaying a JavaScript dialog (WinForms, Lightweight).\nBlurred text on a web page (WPF, WinForms, Lightweight).\nPDF document rendered incorrectly in the environments with non-default DPI settings.",
