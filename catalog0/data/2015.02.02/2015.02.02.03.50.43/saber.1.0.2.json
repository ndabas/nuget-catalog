  "description": "Saber is a small helper framework that allows you to focus on the main logic behind your code, rather than worry about the little things while having to reinvent the wheel over and over again.\n\nThe name \"Saber\" originates from a fictional character from \"Fate/stay night\". \n\nIn Fate/stay night, she is Shir≈ç Emiya's servant. An agile and powerful warrior. Saber is loyal, independent, and reserved; she appears cold, but is actually suppressing her emotions to focus on her goals. Her class is considered the \"Most Outstanding\", with excellent ratings in all categories.",
