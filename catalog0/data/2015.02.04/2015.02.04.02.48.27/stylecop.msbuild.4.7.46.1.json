  "description": "Adds official StyleCop MSBuild targets to your project for running StyleCop analysis with every build. Includes official StyleCop binaries. Works both on a developer workstation (with or without Visual Studio) and on a build server. Does not require installation of StyleCop on any machine. Compatible with NuGet package restore. For update notifications follow https://twitter.com/adamralph. Come and chat to fellow developers about StyleCop and StyleCop.MSBuild at https://jabbr.net/#/rooms/stylecop/.\n\nNOTE: There is a known issue with NuGet Package Manager versions 1.8 to 2.0. See http://nuget.codeplex.com/workitem/2253 for details. If you are using NuGet Package Manager versions 1.8 to 2.0, you are advised to upgrade to version 2.1 or later before installing or updating StyleCop.MSBuild. If you are unable to upgrade to NuGet Package Manager version 2.1 or later and you have problems installing or updating StyleCop.MSBuild, see http://nuget.codeplex.com/workitem/2253 for a workaround. This issue was resolved in NuGet Package Manager version 2.1.\n\nNOTE: If your solution is currently using StyleCop.MSBuild.4.7.17.0 or earlier, updating to a later version will NOT work. Instead of updating, uninstall your current version and then install a later version. See http://adamralph.com/2012/04/17/introducing-stylecop-msbuild/ for an explanation.",
