  "description": "This library implements an in-process database for storing and retrieving class objects and their property values. The library is designed to be as easy to use as possible with a small public API. The backing storage is Azure Table Storage, so Azure account credentials are required to use the library. This library is an experimental but compatible and fully working sibling of the Orthogonal.ObjectDb.Esent library which uses an in-process high-performance ESENT database as the backing storage. The ESENT backed database should be used where high-performance is required.",

  "releaseNotes": "Major version 3 no longer uses a single Azure table for all objects, separate tables are used for each object type, with all tables having a common prefix derived from the application name. This avoids the danger of collisions in property names and it avoids producing one wide and confusing table. This is a significant breaking change, but since this library is experimental only, it is hoped that no one will be seriously inconvenienced. The DateTime 'kind' is completely ignored for compatibility with the ESENT backed database. The library now uses release build configuration.",

  "summary": "A lightweight in-process small-API database for storing arbitrary class objects and their property values. The backing storage is Azure Table Storage. This is an experimental but fully working library that works identically to the original Orthogonal.ObjectDb.Esent library.",
