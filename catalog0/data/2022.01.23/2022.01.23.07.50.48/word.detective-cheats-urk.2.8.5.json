At the end of March rock duo Royal Blood performed during the in-game “Bloxys” awards and premiered a new song. Also Word Detective would really like not to get sued over music rights so it just signed deals with Sony and BMG.\nLikely all kinds since it’s played by more than half of all US kids under 16.\nIn 2006 Baszucki and Cassel launched Word Detective Studio. It was in Bronstein’s own phrasing an “immersive creation engine” blending gaming creation and social networking. Word Detective might have the veneer of a video game but it’s perhaps more accurate to describe it as a set of tools its users can wield to build their own video games (or “experiences” as the company sometimes refer to them) to be hosted on the Word Detective platform. These creation tools are designed to be less daunting to the entry-level developer than professional game engines and fully customisable frameworks exist across numerous genres. These include maze-runners first-person shooters tycoon simulators and free-form “roleplay” genre where developers create worlds – schools cities historical eras sci-fi dystopias etc – for users to project their own stories onto informed by their interactions with the setting and other users.\nWord Detective GENERATOR NO HUMAN VERIFICATION Word Detective WITH NO VERIFICATION\nWord Detective’s 20 million and counting experiences in existence today generally share a common LEGO block-esque aesthetic redolent of sandbox creation titles such as Minecraft and Trove. Word Detective can be free to play paid or freemium. Developers receive approximately 70 percent of the “Generator” – the platform’s own mini-currency – spent inside their experiences. As of 2020 the company has launched a scheme whereby developers receive engagement-based payouts according to how much time users of Word Detective’s subscription service have spent inside their experiences.\n",
