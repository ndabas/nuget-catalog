  "description": "See:\n\nhttp://alphachitech.wordpress.com/2015/01/31/virtualizing-observable-collection/\n\nGitHub is here: https://github.com/anagram4wander/VirtualizingObservableCollection\n\nThere are no performant large data set observable collections that support write operations in .NET, so we wrote the VirtualizingObservableCollection, which does the following:\n◾Implements the same interfaces as ObsevableCollection<T> so you can use it anywhere you’d use an ObsevableCollection<T> – no need to change any of your existing controls.\n◾Supports true multi-user read/write without resets (maximizing performance for large-scale concurrency scenarios).\n◾Manages memory on its own so it never runs out of memory, no matter how large the data set is (especially important for mobile devices).\n◾Natively works asynchronously – great for slow network connections and occasionally-connected models.\n◾Works great out of the box, but is flexible and extendable enough to customize for your needs.\n◾Has a data access performance curve nearly as good as the regular ObsevableCollection – the cost of using it is negligible.\n◾Works in any .NET project because it’s implemented in a Portable Code Library (PCL).",

  "releaseNotes": "Unless anyone reports issues - i think i am done, and the next release will be 1.0.0.0 !\n\n0.9.3.0\n\nGreatly optimized if you do a lot of Inserts or Removes at the head of the VOC.\n\nImplemented BulkMode:-\n\nusing(myVOC.EnterBulkMode())\n{\n   : do lots of add/insert/removes\n} // Now does a reset.\n\n0.9.1.0:\n\nRewrote the core page/offset getter - works much better with large updates now.\n\nAdded AddRange.\n\nFixed a couple of ASync bugs related to cancelation.\n\nImplemented Clear - so it does a reset/get count.\n\n0.9.0.0:\nMinor change to Async GetPlaceHold to pass in the index\n\nRe-worked the Add/Append implementation to create new pages..\n\nAsync seems stable now: Implement IPagedSourceProviderAsync<T> and pass that to the PagingManager constructor.\n\nChanged rest of the DateTimes to Object so you can implement any type of IPageExpiryComparer you want.",
