  "description": "ZXing (pronounced \"zebra crossing\") is an open-source, multi-format 1D/2D barcode image processing library originally implemented by Google in Java.\n\nThis is a Silverlight port of the csharp ZXing port created by Suraj Supekar at revision 1202 in the SVN repository. It was designed for use in the PhraseMeme Scanner application, but can be used to create other Windows Phone or Silverlight applications that scan and process Barcodes.\n\nThe library currently supports:\n\nUPC-A and UPC-E\nEAN-8 and EAN-13\nCode 39\nCode 128\nQR Code\nITF\nData Matrix (Not tested)\nPDF417 (Not tested)",

  "releaseNotes": "1.3 of the Silverlight ZXing Barcode Scanning Library. The code is now separated into two different assemblies:\n\nSilverlight_ZXing_Core.dll contains the pure ZXing library API from http://code.google.com/p/zxing/\nWP7_Barcode_Library.dll contains the Windows Phone 7 specific calling code as well as the sample chooser and other processing logic\nSilverlight_Barcode_Library.dll will be added in a future release with code specific for desktop Silverlight applications\n\nThere is a Samples folder that includes the images you can add to your project if you want to use the BarcodePhotoChooser.xaml page and SampleImages.xml file.\n\nI also added a documentation.chm file that includes all the documentation for ZXing and for the WP7 specific code, as well as a WP7SampleApplication.xap that you can deploy to your phone if you just want to test the library. Unless you are familiar with the ZXing Library I still suggest you download the full source code so you can read the comments about how it works.\n\nThe full source code for the library and sample application can be downloaded here: http://silverlightzxing.codeplex.com/SourceControl/changeset/changes/3bd7fb2d5eb2",
