  "description": "Adds a new type of process with the type name \"ExecutableProcess\", allowing any type of file to be started straight from the exe that is associated with it's filetype. While you can already start files using \"Process.Start\", this allows files to be used in the context of the program, allowing \"UseShellExecute\" and related systems to work properly when starting non-executable filetypes. One key feature that this gives you is the ability to hide any process you want to start that you couldn't normally hide without complex code. Simply put, this package eliminates some weird things that you may have to deal with when using the normal process class. I don't expect this package to be used by most people, because it probably won't help most people, but for anyone who knows about the issue that I'm talking about, this package should solve that issue.",
