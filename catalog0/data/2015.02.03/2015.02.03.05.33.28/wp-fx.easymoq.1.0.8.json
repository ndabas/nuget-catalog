  "description": "EasyMoq is a small and free mocking framework for any kind of project. It is built as a portable class library and uses T4-templating to generate mocks. This makes it a perfect choice for mocking on WP- or WinRT-platform, since there is a lack of dynamic proxy creation.",

  "releaseNotes": "This is the first release and therefore it may not be perfect. But I am using it in my bachelor thesis and this means there will be updates for functionality that ain't work as it should or is missed at the moment.\nCurrently, interface-mocking is the only supported feature.\nIf you miss functionality, feel free to give me feedback.\n\n1.0.8\n*****\n- Mocking internal interfaces is now possible\n\n1.0.7 and earlier\n****************\n- Minor and major fixes in template to generate compilable code.",
