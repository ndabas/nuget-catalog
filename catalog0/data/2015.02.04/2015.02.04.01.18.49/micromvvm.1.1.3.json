  "description": "MVVM\nMicroMVVM fetches the exportable ViewModels found within an application and attaches each ViewModel to the corresponding View. \n\nInversion of Control\nMicroMVVM leverages the Dependency Injection pattern, the framework fetches Transient and Singleton exportable services and injects these interfaces in the ViewModel's constructor.\n\nNavigation\nMicroMVVM.Navigation allows an easy way to navigate from one view to another from the ViewModels. Also provides the means to pass complex objects from one view to another.\n\nServices\nIConnectionService and ILayoutService are available in MicroMVVM.Services to notify the application when the internet connection has been lost and when the application layout has changed. IStorageFileService and IToastMessageService are available to access the files found in the roaming folder and to show toast messages.\n\nBlendabililty\nMicroMVVM offers the facility to include designtime data which can be viewed in Blend and Visual Studio.",
