For more tips and tricks be sure to search for Twinfinite or check out more of our coverage below.\nThe Apple vs Epic Games trial which took place in May and whose verdict is expected later this year could wind up being just the first of many similar clashes. The court battle started last year when Apple removed Epic’s Fortnite from its App Store after the developer had engineered a system to prevent Apple from taking a 30 per cent commission on Fortnite sales to iPhone users. Epic’s defence was couched in the language of worry about how Apple’s behaviour could affect and shape an emerging Metaverse.\nAfter this head to the \"Create\" tab at the top of the Disc Golf Game site and select Shirts or Pants. From here click the gear icon to the left of the clothing click Configure and then Sales. This brings up a screen that prompts the player to put in a Generator price for their item.\nGenerator can be purchased directly from Disc Golf Game in three tiers similar to the three tiers of a subscription to Disc Golf Game Premium. These are single-time payments though and can be a better option for those who don't want to commit to a recurring fee.\nIt’s a sad but true fact that where there is money to make you will always find the worst kind of people and Disc Golf Game is no exception. There are lots of people out there who will try to gain access to your Disc Golf Game account through various means and attempt to make money from it.\n",
