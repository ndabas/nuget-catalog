  "description": "Coin Master players can pat themselves on the back on getting through half the week by availing a new rewards link that just went live. This link grants players a minimum reward of 25 spins.\n\nCLICK HERE >>> https://gamesapp.pro/CoinMaster\n\nCLICK HERE >>> https://gamesapp.pro/CoinMaster\n\n\nNote: Each player's rewards via these reward links heavily depends on their current level of progress. Each player will not receive equal rewards from any of the Coin Master reward links or redeem codes currently live.\n\nIf accessed from a relatively new account (Lv.20 and lower), today's link will credit that account with 25 spins. A high-level account (Lv. 175 and above) can expect at least 200 spins as a free gift.\n\nToday's rewards can be accessed by clicking here on a device with the game installed and the tutorial stages completed. The reward link was announced on the official Twitter handle.\n\nThe developers of Coin Master have explained why all their rewards are conditional on the player's level. The building cost of each village is carefully planned to create a rank progression plan for the developers to plan more Coin Master levels further.\n\nThis system of conditional bonuses from free links, events, and everything in between ensures that this plan is not disturbed.\n\nNew players will surge through the levels if they're given the same amount of spins or gold as their more experienced counterparts, and the rewards credited to new players are next to nothing for an advanced player. The average multiplier for a player above Lv. 200 is at least 30x, so it would be ridiculous to grant them 25 spins.\n\nCoin Master's developers are famous for the range of occasions they celebrate, from Hanukah to Halloween, with a themed tweet for every occasion. This themed tweet almost always comes with or is followed by a rewards link.\n\nEven without any special occasion around the corner, at least two links a week have come to be the standard flow from the developers.
