  "releaseNotes": "This build from https://github.com/SteveGilham/altcover/tree/89ed261454c493651a4efb43a504392cdcc458f5\n\nQ. Never mind the fluff -- how do I get started?\nA. Start with the Quick Start guide : https://github.com/SteveGilham/altcover/wiki/QuickStart-Guide\n\n8.2.836 (Habu series release 12)\n• [BUGFIX] Fix project file path handling in Cake support\n• [BUGFIX] Improve heuristic to recognise (and ignore)  state-machine injected branches in async methods; this may cause subtle changes, up or down, in branch detection for other generated code (\"hidden\" sequence points) contexts with branches\n• Use VS2022 icons in the Visualizer\n\n8.2.835 (Habu series release 11)\n• [BUGFIX] Fix tracked methods in the Merge-OpenCover cmdlet\n• [BUGFIX] Fix blocking issue in Cake support; and add operational test\n• Move Fake.Build support to 5.21 as minimum; updating other supporting libraries\n\n8.2.833 (Habu series release 10)\n• [BUGFIX] Work-round more (problems with ill-formed debug data)[https://github.com/jbevain/cecil/issues/816] (issue #135)\n• [BUGFIX] An infinite loop while instrumenting when faced with an inner function that is also a closure (also issue #135)\n• [BUGFIX] Address issue #71 by pre-allocating storage for each instrumented assembly; rather than allocating on demand, with any timing related issues not adequately dealt with subject to catch-and-ignore\n• For instrumented assemblies, write embedded debug symbols, independent of the input choice.\n• Improved release note formatting\n• Some overhaul and updating of neglected parts of the build and test script\n• Reduce to a minimum the differences in the source between the net20 and net46-for-async versions of the recorder; then just rewrite the net20 version with the delta on demand.\n• Some minor improvements to the data collector for dotnet test use, with example of how to employ explicitly in AltCover \"classic\" mode in the \"UnitTestWithAltCoverCore\" fake build target\n\n8.2.831 (Habu series release 9)\n• [BUGFIX] Make the static-linked parts of the recorder assembly internal, so only the AltCover instrumentation API is exposed -- removes type duplications from the environment that may confuse run-time assembly creation e.g. by Marten (issue #133)\n• For CallContext, add async-aware tracking for all methods returning Task or Task<T> not just ones with the C# async shape.  This includes functions returning the new F#6 task{} computation expression.\n  ◦ Note there is a support gap : running this under .net Framework less than v4.6 (i.e. a test machine with a pre-2015-JUL-20 environment) will not work, even though Task is a .net 4.0 feature, as the tracking support relies on .net 4.6 async features.\n• Emit (a warning)[https://stevegilham.github.io/altcover/AltCover.Engine/AltCover/AltCover.LoggingOptions/Warn-apidoc] if any of the files input to the instrumentations have previously been instrumented, leaving those files untouched (apart from any Recorder assembly, which will still be overwritten).  For dotnet test this is an MSBuild warning, for powershell, it is delivered via Cmdlet.WriteWarning.\n  ◦ This behaviour is subject to change in future releases\n• Rework of the build process to keep artifacts out of the tracked directories\n\n8.2.828 (Habu series release 8)\n• Absorb .net 6 release into build tooling (awaiting a non-preview updated release of (fake.build)[https://fake.build/] to be able to upgrade to FSharp.Core 6.x -- still have to target the v5.x library even if the build uses the F#6 compiler)\n• Where the debug symbols used in the instrumentation contain embedded source (e.g. from source generators), represent that within the generated report --\n  ◦ for OpenCover format, as an altcover.embed attribute added to the File element\n  ◦ for NCover classic, altcover.file elements are added after the method records in a module, with attributes document and embed\n  ◦ and for the extended coverlet JSON format, as a type «AltCover.embed» with an empty method with name being the embedded text.\n• [VISUALIZER] Support the extended formats for display, using the embedded source in preference to the file system whenever present\n• Support these extensions in conversions between formats -- conversion to Lcov and Cobertura currently lose this information\n• Other fixes/enhancements to these conversions, esp. in the cases of partial classes and inlined code\n• Compute summary data correctly in the output from Json to OpenCover\n• Carry both recorder versions (net20 and net46) as resources to simplify self-test behaviour\n• Move baseline Cake support to v1.1.0 and Fake to v5.20.4\n\n8.2.825 (Habu series release 7)\n• Next release will be post .net 6 release to accomodate its impact, barring show-stoppers\n• [BUGFIX] As noted in Q&A discussion (#107), satellite assemblies, and in issue #47  platform specific library subfolders, were not being copied appropriately relative to the instrumented location; this is now resolved.\n• [BUGFIX] Prevent --localSource possibly excluding locally built assemblies using source generators.\n• [VISUALIZER] Fixes and updates\n  ◦ On the global tool, don't put expander icons (˃) on leaf nodes, i.e. most methods, all source -- such icons are an automatic feature in GTK, but are manual in Avalonia.\n  ◦ Don't throw while trying to determine if a file that doesn't exist is outdated\n\n8.2.824 (Habu series release 6c)\n• [VISUALIZER] Fixes and updates\n  ◦ [REGRESSION] Fix where multiple source file support broke JSON coverage support\n  ◦ Not all coverage reports are XML -- fix root node icon\n  ◦ Add more icons indicating non-default states (files missing, changed, via sourcelink &c)\n  ◦ Replace most of the annoying pop-ups with tool-tips\n\n8.2.823 (Habu series release 6b)\n• [VISUALIZER] Fixes and updates\n  ◦ [REGRESSION] Fix where multiple source file support broke methods with no source file\n  ◦ [BUGFIX] Fix where some types were erroneously shown as functions (ƒₓ)\n  ◦ Allow for TAB characters (which occupy 1 column only in the .PDB), and display → rather than ◻ in the global tool (TAB expands to 8 spaces in the GTK# build)\n  ◦ Update icons to VS2019 from VS2017 (except where taken from GTK in the GTK# build), which means slightly more colours in the tree view, and a small change to the branch indicator.\n\n8.2.822 (Habu series release 6a)\n• [VISUALIZER] Support OpenCover's output from C++/CLI assemblies compiled /Zi (line information only, zero column values)\n  ◦ account for (& simplify) the C++/CLI attribute decorations in method names\n  ◦ allow for (& simplify) gcroot<type::with::Cpp::namespacing ^> types in method names\n  ◦ allow source file selection for methods with code inlined from multiple source files\n\n8.2.821 (Habu series release 6)\n• Support deterministic builds /p:ContinuousIntegrationBuild=true, with or without --sourcelink//p:AltCoverSourceLink=true.  Note that assemblies created by deterministic builds will be excluded by -l//p:AltCoverLocalSource=true.\n• Experiment with the ReadMe feature recently added to NuGet\n• Internal refactoring of the JSON processing following the replacement of System.Text.Encodings.Web in the previous release.\n\n8.2.820 (Habu series release 5)\n• Replace System.Text.Encodings.Web for JSON-escaping module, class and method names\n• [BUGFIX] issue #125 -- prevent an NullReferenceException in some cases of computing cyclomatic complexity (a failure to exactly copy the algorithm from Mono.Gendarme)\n• [ENHANCEMENT; API] issue #126 -- further generalise the relative-directory support for CopyAlways/CopyIfNewer from v7.4; extends the ContingentCopy MSBuild task\n\nFor previous releases (8.1.x and earlier) go here -- https://github.com/SteveGilham/altcover/blob/master/ReleaseNotes%20-%20Previously.md",
