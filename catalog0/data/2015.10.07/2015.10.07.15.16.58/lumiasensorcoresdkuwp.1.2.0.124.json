  "description": "Lumia SensorCore SDK is a collection of 4 APIs utilising data from different sensors (for example, accelerometer) and also location information. This information can be used to track user's physical activities and motion. The sensors are able to run constantly in the background, collecting and preserving data for up to past ten days. \n\nWith the Lumia SensorCore SDK one can access to step counter that provides information on how many steps and for how long time the user has been walking. The SDK also provides information about changes in user's physical activity. For example, when user remains stationary, or starts or stops walking. \n\nThe SDK also provides user location information including a list of geo-coordinates where the user has spent some time and user's home and work location and information about user's movements. \n\nAll SensorCore APIs are now being deprecated. The APIs will continue to work in existing devices, but it is not guaranteed that new devices would support SensorCore any more. Instead, you should look into Windows platform APIs for activity monitoring and step counting. They will replace SensorCore APIs and will be supported by upcoming devices. However, they will not be supported by the majority of existing devices. Therefore, as an intermediary solution, you might want to use both APIs in your application. Unfortunately, Place Monitor and Track Point Monitor do not have equivalent OS APIs available as of yet.\nWe recommended that you start migrating existing apps to use Lumia SensorCore Step Counter or Activity Monitor APIs to the corresponding Windows platform APIs. We do not recommended that you use Lumia SensorCore APIs in any new apps.\n\t\t \nPlatform requirement: Lumia Windows Phone 8.1 or Lumia Windows Phone 10",
