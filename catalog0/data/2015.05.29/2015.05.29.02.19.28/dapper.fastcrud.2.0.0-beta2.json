  "description": "The fastest micro-orm type extension for Dapper.\n\nFor Dapper constructs in general, it is recommended to use Visual Studio 2015 for features such as nameof and string interpolation, but that's not a requirement.\n\nThe package contains .NET 4.5 and 4.6 DLLs, one of which will be installed based on the target framework in your project. \nFor .NET 4.5, the code contains the polyfills for the missing FormattableString class, which is required when targetting that framework version and using string interpolation with the C# 6 compiler in VS 2015.\n\nFeatures:\n----------\n- Support for LocalDb, Ms Sql Server, MySql, SqLite, PostgreSql\n- Entities having composite primary keys are supported\n- Multiple entity mappings are supported.\n- All the CRUD methods accept a transaction, a command timeout, and a custom entity mapping.\n- Fast pre-computed entity queries\n- A simple Sql builder with alias support is provided, which is very useful when manual SQL queries are unavoidable.\n- A generic T4 template is also provided for convenience. Entity domain partitioning and generation can be achieved via separate template configurations.\nThe installation package includes a sample config file SampleModelGeneratorConfig.tt which you can rename and tweak at will. \nCode first entities are also supported which can either be decorated with attributes such as Table, Key and DatabaseGenerated, or can have their mappings programmatically set.\n\nExamples of usage:\n-------------------\n- using Dapper.FastCrud\n- dbConnection.Insert(newEntity);\n- dbConnection.Get()\n- dbConnection.Get(new Entity() {Id = 10});\n- dbConnection.Update(updatedEntity);\n- dbConnection.Delete(entity)\n- dbConnection.Find<Entity>(\n      whereClause:$\"{nameof(Entity.FirstName)}=@FirstNameParam\",\n      orderClause:$\"{nameof(Entity.LastName)} DESC\",\n      skipRowsCount:10, limitRowsCount:20,\n      queryParameters: new {FirstNameParam: \"John\"});\n\nThis is where the power of the C# 6 compiler comes into play, and leaves no chance to mistypings or to problems arising from db entity refactorings.\nMore details and benchmarks are available on the project site.",
