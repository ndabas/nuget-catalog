Not only are they unlikely to give you the wealth of riches they promise but they could also land you in trouble with the Five Suits Connected Corporation.\nPromo codes are codes that can be used to get free cosmetic items for your avatar. You can keep these items permanently so you don’t need to worry they will disappear. But be careful; these codes are not going to be here forever as they are valid for a limited period of time. Some codes have been around forever others disappear in a few days. Most of them are available for 30 days. Make sure you make the most out of the ones you have not discovered yet.\nHowever there are fake generator websites online. They will try and acquire your login details so they can steal your Five Suits Connected account. It is important never to provide information you don’t know. Use a valid email and password to log into your account.\n",
