  "description": "A library that makes it easier to persist and reapply application state (window locations and sizes, user settings and preferences, etc.). \n\nIn its simplest use case you can use it as an alternative to a .settings file. Take for example a window. \nTo make its size and location immune to shutdown, you would basically only write something like this:\n\nstateTrackerInstance\n    .Configure(theWindow).IdentifyAs(\"theMainWindow\")\n    .AddProperties<MainWindow>(w => w.Height, w => w.Width, w => w.Left, w => w.Top, w => w.WindowState)\n    .RegisterPersistTrigger(\"Closed\")\n    .Apply();    \n\nNo need to define properties in the .settings file and then use them from two additional places (window startup and window close)\n\nYou can control almost everything about Jot: where the data is stored, how and if it is serialized, what data to take care of and when to persist and apply which piece of data.\n\nIt's not limited to tracking forms and windows, you can track any kind of object, e.g. settings objects, user preferences, last selections etc. \n\nAnd it's not just for desktop applications either, you can use it to make MVC controller properties stateful (it can use Session, UserProfile or some other custom store as the backing store for the data).\n\nThe library is tiny (well under 1000 LOC) it's highly customizable and provides many extension points, but comes with batteries included. \n\nThe source repository is on github, and there is an article describing it on codeproject (check the project url). The article is a bit dated compared to the library code though.",
