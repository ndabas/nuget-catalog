  "description": "Backed by the IPFS Shipyard and developer community. Picking up where Richard Schneider / makaretu left off.\n      Core objects and interfaces for IPFS.\n\n      The InterPlanetary File System is the permanent web. IPFS enables the creation of completely distributed applications. It is a new hypermedia distribution protocol, addressed by content and identities. It aims to make the web faster, safer, and more open.",

  "releaseNotes": "--- 0.3.0 ---\nA full analysis of the Bitswap API was made to bring it in line with Kubo's RPC API.\n\n[Breaking]\nGetAsync and UnwantAsync were removed from IBitswapApi. These were not part of Kubo's API, but were intended for custom implementations. To migrate, derive IBitswapApi and add your custom functionality in your library. See also https://discord.com/channels/806902334369824788/942673321852563456/1225047628602151084.\nThe return type for IBlockApi.GetAsync was changed from IDataBlock to byte[], since IDataBlock was removed in 0.2.0. Kubo's RPC API (including the JS implementation) simply returns the buffer, and so are we now.\nILinkedNode was removed as it was not used anywhere in the broader net-ipfs codebase and seems to have been placed there years ago for future plans that were never carried out.\n\n--- 0.2.0 ---\n[Breaking]\nIDataBlock.DataStream was removed. This pattern encouraged async calls behind synchronous property getters, which is a bad practice and can cause deadlocks. Call the async methods directly on the API instead.\nThe obsolete IFileSystemApi.ListFileAsync was removed due to prior deprecation and removal in Kubo 0.26.0. Use IFileSystemApi.ListAsync and MfsApi.StatAsync instead. See https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/issues/7493#issuecomment-2016563729.\n\n[New]\nAdded missing IFileSystemApi.ListAsync. Doesn't fully replace the removed IFileSystemApi.ListFileAsync, but is a step in the right direction. See https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/issues/7493#issuecomment-2016563729.",
