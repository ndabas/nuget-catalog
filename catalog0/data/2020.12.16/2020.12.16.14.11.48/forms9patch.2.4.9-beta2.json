  "description": "Xamarin Forms is great for developing apps on Android, iOS, and Universal Windows Platform (UWP) but it is missing some important features: \n- Scalable images\n- NetStandard, PCL and Shared Library, multi-screen / multi-resolution image management\n- HTML formatted text for labels and buttons\n- NetStandard, PCL and Shared Library custom font management\n- Hardware keyboard key detection\n- On-Screen software keyboard height change events\n- Support for multiple items of the same MIME type on the clipboard\n- Support for inter-app Data Sharing\n\nAndroid developers can use NinePatch bitmaps, the drawable directory naming convention, Html.FromHtml, and a bunch of complex file manipulations to address the image issue.  Likewise, iOS developers can use ResizeableImageWithCapInsets, the @2x, @3x, @4x file naming convention, and some 3rd party libraries for this purpose.  Forms9Patch enhances Xamarin Forms to make multi-resolution / multi-screen image management, custom fonts, and HTML text formatting easy for NetStandard, PCL, and Shared Libary apps for iOS,  Android and UWP",
