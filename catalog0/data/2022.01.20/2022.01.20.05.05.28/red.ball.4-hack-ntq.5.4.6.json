In other words there’s no limit to the number of free Gems you can get.\nThe first step to earning a lot of Generator is to build your own game within Red Ball 4 that other players can enjoy. Once your game has a following then Red Ball 4 will use a metric to see how many premium players often play this game and then you will be rewarded with a stipend.\nAnd it’s not just amateurs making Red Ball 4 games — there are entire studios dedicated to Red Ball 4. I spoke with one The Gang Stockholm while writing this article and they’ve now built an official Nerf battle arena game for toymaker Hasbro. One of Red Ball 4’s top games Adopt Me grew from a two-person development team to being supported by a full development studio that has ambitions to hire 100 developers by the end of next year.\nThe Paid Access games are not eligible for these types of payouts and you don't need to do anything to enroll in this program.\n",
