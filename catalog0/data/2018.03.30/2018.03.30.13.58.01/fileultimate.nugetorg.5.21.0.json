  "releaseNotes": "## Version 5.21.0 - March 30, 2018\n\n  - **Fixed:** Document Viewer was broken (\"engine not found\" errors) in v5.20.5 due to obfuscation.\n\n  - **Added:** Implemented own routing for better CMS compatibility (e.g. SiteFinity, DotNetNuke)\n    CMSs usually take over and clear System.Web.Routing.RouteTable so as a result resource and component handlers \n    were not accessible (HTTP 404 errors) unless you called FileUltimateConfiguration.RestoreRoutes method. \n    Removed FileUltimateConfiguration.RestoreRoutes method as it's no longer necessary.\n\n  - **Fixed:** IE 8 support was broken, FileManager failed to load with errors in browser console. Now it will render\n    as expected.\n\n  - **Fixed:** \"Open\" action (open in browser) in FileManager failed with HTTP 404 error for files in very deep folders.\n    This happened because the generated URL for \"Open\" action was too long. IIS and ASP.NET usually have 255 character \n    limit by default in URL path part (due to legacy Windows limit).\n    The reason we generated a long URL path was specially for being able to view HTML files which has references \n    to css and images (e.g. ../images/image1.jpg). This way relative paths inside the HTML work and images are not broken.\n    However when you open a .txt file or .pdf file in browser this path in URL is pointless so from now on this\n    feature will be limited to .html or .html files. So for file types other than HTML, the path is moved \n    to querystring (parts after ? by default allow long strings) to prevent HTTP 404 error in very deep folders.\n\n  - **Improved:** Document Viewer and image thumbnailer/viewer stability.",
