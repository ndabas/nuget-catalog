Tix didn’t cost money and players could earn by it logging in daily visiting their Place and a number of other ways. Tix could also be converted into Generator which is something players used to do a lot. Considering that it was just a free way to earn Generator people started creating alternate accounts to get more Generator and it almost entirely killed the point of Generator.\nIt should be noted that a majority of sites offering Generator for free are not legit. Most of the servers are filled with users spamming this site link which is likely not real users at all.However when players try to go to the blox.surf website the get redirected to blox.land website. This website is a survey website and after completing a survey players will get some Generator into their account. Users have reported that they have successfully got Generator after going through the withdrawal process without getting their accounts promised.\nby the way\tWetter than an otter’s pocket\tsoy face\tTSIF\tgeorgia rose\n",
