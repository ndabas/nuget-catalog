  "description": "This class is a port of DataJuggler.Net for the .Net Framework, which is used by \nDataTier.Net and DB Compare to read SQL Server database schema and code generate stored procedure\ndriven data tiers.\n\nThe two main classes are:\nSQLDatabaseConnector - A wrapper for SqlDatabaseConnection that reads database schema.\n\nCSharpClassWriter - A class that is useful in code generating C# classes.",

  "releaseNotes": "4.18.2022: After only 18 years, I discovered that I the data type Date in SQL Server was not mapped.\n\t\tI always use DateTime, but I have a project with just Date data type and realized this isn't parsed.\n\t\tOne of the advantages of being unpopular is no one sees my mistakes.\n\t\t\n\t\t4.14.2022: I added two properties to DataTable and StoredProcedure classes, to keep track of\n\t\tUsesAnsiNulls and UseQuotedIdentifiers. I now set these objects when I load the DatabaseSchema.\n\t\tIt turns out, the text for the Defition of the View or Stored Procedure already had this, so not\n\t\treally needed. Generate Scripts now creates missing fields, tables, views and stored procedures.\n\t\tNext is constraints and keys and that is 99% of all updates I do.\n\t\t\n\t\t4.13.2022: I added a new method to SQL Database Connector to get the text for a view. This was needed for \n\t\tDB Compare had a bug when it tried to generate sql for a view. Tables are easy, views I had to get the actual text\n\t\tto make sure all the joins are correct.\n\t\t\n\t\t12.31.2021\n\t\tVersion 6.0.1: I upgraded the reference to Microsoft.Data.SqlClient to 4.0.0. Turns out this breaks everything without encrypt =false,\n\t\tso I took this out.\n\t\t\n\t\t3.0.6: I added a new property called CreatedFilePaths. This list of strings will contain the full path of all\nfiles created during WriteClasses method.\n\nAlso, I found out why I had problems with Nuget version 3.0.2 - 3.0.5. I had a project reference and a Nuget reference, and Nuget and / or Visual Studio didn't like it.\n\nVersion 3.0.5: I updated the Read Me about a new project that uses CSharpClassWriter.\n\nVersion 3.0.4: Not sure why, but Nuget was giving me warning on 3.0.3 version. Trying again.\n\nVersion 3.0.3: I made a few changes to CSharpClassWriter to make it easier to code generate from outside DataTier.Net. My project DataJuggler.Excelerate now has a code generator, so the header row in an Excel sheet\ncan be used to create a class.\n\nVersion 3.0.1: I created a default constructor for CSharpClassWriter, so it is not only for DataTier.Net\n\nUpdate 9.15.2021\nVersion 3.0.2: I added DataType object for code generation outside of DataTier.Net.\n\nVersion 3.0.0: I changed out System.Data.SqlClient to Microsoft.Data.SqlClient, so I updated this package to\nversion 3.0.0 to be the same version as Microsoft.Data.SqlClient.\n\nVersion 2.5.1: I added 2 new methods to SQLDatabaseConnector for FindTable and FindTableIndex. It surprises me this doesn't exist somewhere in the app.\n\nVersion 2.5.0: This version converted the .Net Core version to .Net 5. All the different names confuse even me, so I am trying to get down to everything I keep working on is .Net 5. \n\n      I added new properties named Tag to DataField, DataRow and DataTable classes. I use these fields in a new\n      project I am working on called DataDiff, which will be used to find changes before and after something happens.\n\n      I updated the reference to System.Data.SqlClient to 4.8.0\n      I updated the reference to DataJuggler.UltimateHelper.Core to version 1.1.4",
