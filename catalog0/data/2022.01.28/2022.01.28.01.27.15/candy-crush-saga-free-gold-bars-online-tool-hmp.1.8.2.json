The court battle started last year when Apple removed Epic’s Fortnite from its App Store after the developer had engineered a system to prevent Apple from taking a 30 per cent commission on Fortnite sales to iPhone users. Epic’s defence was couched in the language of worry about how Apple’s behaviour could affect and shape an emerging Metaverse.\nWhat has made CANDY CRUSH SAGA FREE GOLD BARS ONLINE TOOL unique in its field has been the interplay between its enormous constellation of experiences and its personalised avatar system. When you enter any given CANDY CRUSH SAGA FREE GOLD BARS ONLINE TOOL world the user does not assume control of a context-relevant character (think Sonic Mario or Lara Croft) but as your persistent user-created avatar. A virtual You effectively – whoever you’ve chosen to be. Add to that an attendant in-game economy which has sprung up to support this expression of identity with all sorts of user-generated clothing hairstyles accessories and skins available to purchase in the platform’s avatar shop.
