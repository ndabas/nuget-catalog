  "description": "This project is a spin-off of the original \"Throttling Suite for ASP.NET Applications\" with improved capabilities providing implementation for .NET Web API framework. The implementation supports all available hosting options provisioning equal functionality for IIS-hosted and OWIN self-hosted solutions. It is specifically designed to throttle high performance and high throughput Web API applications.\n\nThe library contains multiple controller types implementing different throttling algorithms:\nLinear throttling - limits the number of calls by enforcing consistent delay between consequent requests;\nShort Average - limits the number of calls by ensuring consistent average over period of time, but allowing to have smaller traffic bursts for short time intervals; this type of throttling is very helpful cutting HTTP request floods;\nLong Average - limits the number of calls by specified number of requests per configured duration as short-average does, but includes \"blocked\" calls into total count, penalizing client for excessive application use.\n\nEach throttling controller is capable of unique client determination and management. The throttling for any end-point, or set of end-points can be configured either for the entire application, or per-client. It does not purely rely on client IP address, allowing multiple clients from the same network concurrently making requests to the server. \nThe Throttling Suite allows setting multiple controllers within the application and applying each to a pre-filtered traffic. The filters are also configurable.\n\nThe Throttling Suite provides two modes: real blocking mode when request is blocked with 429 HTTP Status code and log-only mode.\n\nThe code is highly optimized having very low memory impact. The throttling evaluation functionality takes less than 0.3 ms to run.\n\nThe v1.2 is updated to include \"Retry-After\" response header in the blocked response helping API client to negotiate the request rate with API server side. \n\nThe v1.2 also allows to ignore the actual request URL substituting one with Throttling controller instance scope. This provides the benefit to count requests for multiple API endpoints toward the same throttling threshold.\n\nThe v1.3 enables configuration from the code rather than XML *.config file.\n\nThe v1.3.1 simplifies configuration from the code using additional shortcut methods. It also improves handling for application virtual path root.",
