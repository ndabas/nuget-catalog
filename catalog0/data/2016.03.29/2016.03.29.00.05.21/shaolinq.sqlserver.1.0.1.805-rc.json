  "description": "Shaolinq is a thoughtfully designed ORM and Linq provider for .NET\n    \nUse this package to add Shaolinq and out-of-the-box MySql support.\n    \nDesigned to perform super fast and be easy to use, Shaolinq's features also include:\n    \n- First class schema-first ORM with WYSIWYG data access and minipulation.\n- First class LINQ support (not the basic kind you see in most other OSS projects).\n- Single trip updating of objects.\n- Support for Sqlite, MySql, Postgres and SQL Server.\n- Automatic database creation and schema migration.\n- Delete LINQ extension for batch server side deletes.\n- Full support for server side date functions (Date.DayOfWeek etc).\n- Easily extensible with a simple interface for adding support for other ADO.NET compatible databases.\n- Open Source!",

  "releaseNotes": "- Support ***DeflatedPredicated*** references including single trip updates and referencing of such objects.\n- New Roslyn based generation of SqlExpressionComparer and SqlExpressionHasher.\n-- Previous --\n- Support ProjectionExpression caching\n- Fixed bug where ToListAsync() would erase any included collections on return\n- Support UNION and UNION ALL support (Queryable.Union and Queryable.Concat)\n- Removed requirement for DataAccessObjects and PersistedMembers to be abstract\n- ComputedMember language/parser improvements\n- Added support for Queryable.All queries\n- Added async versions of Queryable.Any and Queryable.All queries\n- Added predicate versions of Single, SingleOrDefault, First, FirstOrDefault\n- Support Delete and Delete(predicate) on all compatible Queryables (not just DataAccessObjects)\n- Support GetReference on objects where primary key values are provided using related computed member values\n- Added SumAsync, AverageAsync, MinAsync, MaxAsync methods\n- Better async support when using DataAccessScope\n- Better support for CompleteAsync\n- Functional async support for Postgres\n- Using AsyncRewriter to generate async methods\n- Fixed some nested projection with GroupBy bugs\n- Added DataAccessScope for async commit support\n- Support Include on collections without TransactionScope\n- Lots of Include collection fixes\n- Support joins with multiple join conditions using anonymous types either side of join 'equals' \n- Fixed memory leaks related to lambda projector cache\n- Full support for using Include() on RelatedDataAccessObject properties (collections) including recursive Includes within the collection values.\n- Better/more-complete support for GroupJoins\n- Support for SelectMany returning RelatedDataAccessObjects (Queryable) collections\n- Much improved support/implementation for aggregates and DefaultIfEmpty \n- Improved GroupBy and nested select/projection query support\n- Support implicit joins in many more places that take selectors/predicates such as Queryable.First, Queryable.Single, Queryable.Min, Queryable.Max, Queryable.Count etc.\n- Support join conditions that require implicit joins to resolve\n- Support DataAccessObjects with custom primary keys (inherited from Shaolinq.DataAccessObject instead of Shaolinq.DataAccessObject{T})\n- Support SelectForUpdate, WhereForUpdate on IQueryable\n- Fixed deadlocks in some async calls\n- Fixed inline call to a function returning IQueryable inside a query sometimes fails\n- TransactionContext optimisations\n- Fixed compiled projector lambda cache sometimes not caching due to a bug in SqlExpressionComparer\n- Various async fixes\n- Added NamingTransforms to DataAccessModelConfiguration\n- Fix objects with DAO primary keys using references and anonymous types\n- Better in-scope object caching performance \n- DAO primary keys mostly working with tests",
