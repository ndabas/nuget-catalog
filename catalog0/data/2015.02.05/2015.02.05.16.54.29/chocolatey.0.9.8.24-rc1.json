  "description": "Chocolatey is a package manager for Windows (like apt-get but for Windows). It was designed to be a decentralized framework for quickly installing applications and tools that you need. It is built on the NuGet infrastructure currently using PowerShell as its focus for delivering packages from the distros to your door, err computer.\n\nChocolatey is brought to you by the work and inspiration of the community, the work and thankless nights of the Chocolatey Team (https://github.com/orgs/chocolatey/members), and Rob heading up the direction.\n\nYou can host your own sources and add them to chocolatey, you can extend chocolatey's capabilities, and folks, it's only going to get better.\n\n== Commands ==\nThere are quite a few commands you can call - you should check out the command reference at: https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/CommandsReference\n\n * Search - choco search something\n * List - choco list -lo\n * Install - choco install baretail\n * Update - choco update baretail\n * Uninstall - choco uninstall baretail\n * Install ruby gem - choco install compass -source ruby\n * Install python egg - choco install sphynx -source python\n * Install windows feature - choco install IIS -source windowsfeatures\n * Install webpi feature - choco install IIS7.5Express -source webpi\n\nMore advanced commands and switches listed on the command reference, including how you can force a package to install the x86 version of a package.\n\n== Create Packages? ==\nWe have some great guidance on how to do that. Where? I'll give you a hint, it rhymes with sticky! https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/CreatePackages\n\nIn that mess there is a link to the Helper Reference - https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/HelpersReference\n\n== Chocolatey gods? ==\nHumor related to playing off of tiki gods. We like humor. Don't take life so seriously, you will never get out alive.",
