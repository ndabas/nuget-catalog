  "description": "How To Use 10 Off Boost On [Cash App] :\n\nCLICK HERE TO HACK >>> https://eagames.xyz/cashapp~dae\n\nCash App is one of the popular options to make payments for your everyday purchases. A great feature in Cash App is the Boost that gives you instant discounts at selected merchants or categories. If you are a Cash App user, this post is loaded with tips and information on how to use Cash App Boost to save money First things first, you need to have a Cash App Card to use the boost feature (so get the card first if you have not applied for it). TheCash App Boost feature does not get automatically turned on even if you have the card. You need to activate the specific boost in Cash App, before you make the purchases. Lets see how to activate and use the Cash App Boost.Open the Cash App on your mobile Tap on Cash Card Tab on the Cash App Home Screen Next tap on the button Save with Boost Next scroll through the options and select a Boost of your choice to view the offer details Tap on Add Boost and you will get a confirmation that the Boost is added to your Cash CardOnce you tap on the Boost, it will show you the offer details like the percentage you will get off, validity of the offer, how many times you can use it etc. And you will get the button to Add Boost at the end. Just tap on it to get the boost activated, which is then displayed right below the Cash App card image.Once the boost is activated, go ahead to complete the transaction at selected merchant using your Cash App Card. The instant discount is usually auto-applied. You will receive a confirmation message that Boost was applied and only the net amount gets debited on your Cash app card. Only one boost can be active at a time, but you always swap the active boost to replace with another one you like. So make sure you have the right boost added to the card before doing the transaction. You can always check the Cash App Card tab on the app screen to see which boost is currently active on your Card (it is displayed right below the card image). Also, note most of the Cash App Boost works even for online transactions using your Cash App Card. e.g. if you have activated the DoorDash boost on your app before placing the order online on the DoorDash App, it will automatically apply the discount once you place the order. Do note the Boost details when you tap on it which shows conditions like minimum amount of purchase required, expiration date, how many times you can use the boost within a time period (sometimes it can be once an hour or once every 6 hours) and maximum discount that you can get.
