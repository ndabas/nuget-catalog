Whenever you upgrade it with the same kind of material, you'll gain a huge experience increase. Whenever you equip several items made from the same material, you'll gain a synergy bonus to boost your attack and defense abilities. Whenever you reach the greatest degree of equipment, you will have the ability to evolve equipment with a specific number of specific materials (depending about what it is). The specific evolution will not bring a great statistical improvement, but the actual benefit lies in the very first upgrade. Your equipment is likely to be degraded at level 1, so one upgrade can upgrade your equipment to multiple levels. Take part in these activities each time they appear, since these activities are always one of the best ways to acquire rare new equipment.",
