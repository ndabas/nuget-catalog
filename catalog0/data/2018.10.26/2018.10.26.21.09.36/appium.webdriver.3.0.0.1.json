These options are going to be removed at the next .Net client release.\n      The ability to start Appium node programmatically using desired capabilities. This feature is compatible with Appium node server v >= 1.5.x.\n\n      1.5.0.1\n      Update to Selenium.Webdriver v2.48.2 and Selenium.Support v2.48.2\n      The ability to start appium server programmatically was provided.
