Our moderators will be able to take correct action against people trying to scam your account. You will also be helping to make Project Makeover an even better place! You can adjust your Settings to prevent others from sending these sorts of messages by selecting Privacy and choose who is allowed to send you messages chats and more.\"\nProject Makeover GENERATOR Project Makeover GENERATOR NO HUMAN VERIFICATION 2020\nMore often than not you can’t use a Project Makeover account generator through any legitimate means. Though they may appear on sites like Reddit to actually get the account you’ll need to join closed Discord servers and download specific software that isn’t verified by the game’s developers. Therefore you’re taking a huge risk with your device’s security by downloading them as they could contain anything from viruses to spyware. They’re also pretty unreliable. If you go to the trouble of downloading one it might not even work.\nYou can repeatedly kill Mr. Rich each hour and take the Cyclops Eye to the wizard to keep earning 20 Gems for free. In other words there’s no limit to the number of free Gems you can get.\nProject Makeover NO HUMAN VERIFICATION Project Makeover VERIFIED BY FORTNITE\nThe recent update in Project Makeover Wacky Wizards introduced gems as a new currency. Similar to Generator gems can be used for purchasing premium ingredients and cauldron skins in the game. Apart from purchasing gems with real money players can also use a free alternative to acquire gems.\n",
