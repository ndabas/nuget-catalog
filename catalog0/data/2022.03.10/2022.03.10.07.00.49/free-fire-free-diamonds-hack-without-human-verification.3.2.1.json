  "description": "free fire free Diamonds HAck without human verification\n\nCLICK HERE TO GETðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰  https://getfreegem.com/freefire/\n\nThe boss fight is quite challenging but quite easy too. He's like a big spider and you need to hit him a lot in order to be able to damage him enough so that you get free coins. He's faster than you, so you'll have to keep hitting him to make him flinch. If you get hit and stand still, he will grab you and slam his jaws around until you get free coins!\n\nOnce you get the first five or six coins the challenge stops for that time. However if you don't get free coins during this time then you'll have to wait until the next wave comes. As long as you can collect all the flames you can you will progress through the levels. There are also bonus rooms in this game which will help you get more coins and other things to help you get through the levels.\n\nAfter you reach the end of the level there will be an animated sequence that plays. Go to the right as usual and the cut scene will play where you will get to see the boss fight. The animation will be quite funny and it will make you laugh a lot. When it's finished you will unlock the next part which will be the final battle. Prepare yourself as you'll be needing all the help you can get here.\n\n\nCLICK HERE TO GETðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰  https://getfreegem.com/freefire/\n\nGarena free fire hack.com diamond,\nFree Fire Hack Without Human Verification,\nGarena Free Fire hack no survey,\nGarena Free Fire hack app download,\nFree Fire Diamonds Generator,\nGarena free fire hack cheats online get unlimited coins and diamonds,\nGarena free fire hack and cheats online,\n",
