These were “simulated physics laboratories” which allowed users to design environments they could experiment within – by constructing destructible houses for instance or crashing two cars together at various speeds or maybe by taking the tools in altogether weirder and more unexpected directions.\nFREE V BUCKS SURVEY was created and launched in 2006 but it's still enjoyed by millions of players all over the world.
