  "description": "Processing.js is the sister project of the popular visual programming language Processing, designed for the web. Processing.js makes your data visualizations, digital art, interactive animations, educational graphs, video games, etc. work using web standards and without any plug-ins. You write code using the Processing language (or JavaScript), include it in your web page, and Processing.js does the rest.\n\nProcessing.js is perhaps best thought of as a JavaScript runtime for the Processing language. Where Processing relies upon Java for its graphics back-end, Processing.js uses the web--HTML5, canvas, and WebGL--to create 2D and 3D graphics, without developers having to learn those APIs and technologies.\n\nOriginally developed by Ben Fry and Casey Reas, Processing started as an open source programming language based on Java to help the electronic arts and visual design communities learn the basics of computer programming in a visual context. Processing.js takes this to the next level, allowing Processing code to be run by any HTML5 compatible browser, including current versions of Firefox, Safari, Chrome, Opera, and Internet Explorer. Processing.js brings the best of visual programming to the web, both for Processing and web developers.\n\nMuch like the native language, Processing.js is a community driven project, and continues to grow as browser technology advances. Processing.js is now compatible with Processing, and has an active developer and user community.",
