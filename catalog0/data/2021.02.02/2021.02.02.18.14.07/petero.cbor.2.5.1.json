  "description": "A C# implementation of Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR), a general-purpose binary data format defined in RFC 7049. According to that RFC, CBOR's data model \"is an extended version of the JSON data model\", supporting many more types of data than JSON. This implementation was written by Peter O. and is released to the Public Domain under the CC0 Declaration.\n    This implementation also doubles as a reader and writer of JSON, and can convert data from JSON to CBOR and back.",

  "releaseNotes": "In version 2.5.1:\n* Really sign the CBOR assembly with a strong name key\nIn version 2.4.2:\n* Really use 0.2.2 of\n  [`PeterO.Numbers`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/PeterO.Numbers)\n  as dependency in NuGet package\nIn version 2.4.1:\n* C# implementation now uses version 0.2.2 of\n  [`PeterO.Numbers`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/PeterO.Numbers)\nIn version 2.4:\n* The arbitrary-precision classes in this library are being replaced\n with a new library (called PeterO.Numbers (https://www.nuget.org/packages/PeterO.Numbers) in C#).  As a result, most\n of the methods in the existing classes are obsolete.  This affects the\n classes `BigInteger`, `ExtendedDecimal`, `ExtendedFloat`, `ExtendedRational`,\n `Rounding`, `PrecisionContext`, and `TrapException`.  Changes were made\n to those classes to call the new classes, and the behavior is mostly\n compatible with the previous behavior (with the notable exception\n of a new dependency in the CBOR library).\n* After version 2.3.1, the classes in the new library were greatly changed\n from what they were in version 2.3.1.  Version 2.4.0 currently uses\n version 0.2 of the new library, but this may change in future versions.  See the\n  new library's release notes (https://github.com/peteroupc/Numbers),\n and this repository's commit history (from \"version 2.3.1\"\n to \"move big number library...\") for details.\n* The FromObject method of the CBORObject class can now convert\n arbitrary-precision number objects from the new library\n appropriately, such as `EInteger` and `EDecimal`.  However, there are\n no methods that directly take or return one of those classes, for\n compatibility with version 2.0.\n* Added Zero field and IsNegative property to the CBORObject class\n* Added overloads to ReadJSON and FromJSONString in CBORObject class\n* Added parameter in the ParseJSONNumber method of CBORDataUtilities\n to preserve negative zeros\n* Added CBOR decoding option to disable duplicate keys\n* Fixed JSON parsing bugs\nSee the project page for release notes on previous versions: https://github.com/peteroupc/CBOR",
