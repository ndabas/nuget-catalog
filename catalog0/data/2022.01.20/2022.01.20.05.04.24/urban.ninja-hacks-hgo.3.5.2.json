Prepare 5 Nuclear potions by combining 5 Giant’s ear and 5 Dynamite. Once done prepare 5 Hot potions using 5 Chilli Peppers. Gather all the potions and put them inside the cannon aiming towards Cyclops boss. Fire them one by one and decimate Mr. Rich’s entire health. Keep in mind you need to put the potions inside the cannon in quick succession as Mr. Rich will start to regenerate health if you take too long.\nUrban Ninja GENERATOR NO HUMAN VERIFICATION A Urban Ninja OBBY\nUrban Ninja NO HUMAN VERIFICATION GAMES THAT GIVE U Urban Ninja\nThere are however a few easy things you can do to minimise the risk. First off as mentioned above don’t tell your kid the password to their Urban Ninja account. The reason behind this is the ‘Urban Ninja’ scams that proliferate the internet. These sites get your details by disguising themselves as sites that look like an official Urban Ninja page and encourage people to log into their Urban Ninja account via their page to claim ‘Urban Ninja’. If you do this you have just given the scammers all of the information they need to take over the account and clear it out. No matter how tempting these sites are you need to know that there is NO SUCH THING AS Urban Ninja. Only purchase Generator using the methods mentioned before.\nCreating a game in the Urban Ninja engine might seem easy but it's actually incredibly difficult to get everything to work 100% correctly. It's more intuitive than other game design engines but it's not any less difficult to come up with a new idea that will capture regular visitors' attention.\n",
