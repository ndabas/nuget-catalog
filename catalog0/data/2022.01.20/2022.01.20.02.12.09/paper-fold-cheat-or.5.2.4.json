Even a single premium ingredient costs a lot of gems so donâ€™t expect the free method to be super beneficial. Unfortunately this is the only method to get free gems in Paper Fold Wacky Wizards That said players can always buy gems from the store using real money.\nFor any player that wants to redeem the promos simply go to the Promo Code Redemption Page and enter the code in the \"Enter Your Code\" box. After a code has been entered the player can find the redeemed item in the Inventory within the category it belongs to. For example a hat will be in the Inventory under Accessories. Now here are all the August codes that players can use in the game along with related rewards.\nPaper Fold was created and launched in 2006 but it's still enjoyed by millions of players all over the world. The fact it has managed to stay so popular is a testament to how exciting it is. But one of the main reasons why the game struck a chord with gamers is because it's free to play and best of all the developers consistently release free content such as this month's bunch of promo codes.\nPaper Fold GENERATOR NO HUMAN VERIFICATION Paper Fold VAN\nThis model has been staggeringly successful for both Paper Fold Studios and its developers alike.
