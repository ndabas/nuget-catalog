  "releaseNotes": "## Version 5.5.5 - October 17, 2016\n\n- **Added:** Visual Studio Design View support. From now on, an image preview (placeholder) of FileManager control \n  will be displayed in Design View. This preview is also resizable and it directly reflects Width and Height properties.\n\n- **Fixed:** Visual Studio Design View error: \n \"Cannot create an object of type 'GleamTech.FileSystems.Location' from its string representation...\"\n\n- **Fixed:** Amazon S3 root folders can now list more than 1000 items. Also improved listing performance of folders so\n  you should not have any problems with huge buckets.\n  \n- **Fixed:** When Amazon S3 bucket was empty, it caused an error.\n\n- **Fixed:** ClientLoading event was being fired too late, some functions like fileManager.onViewRefresh are registered \n  as event handlers to internal components so even you override them later the components still referred to the old \n  function reference, so Ext.override was not working. From now on ClientLoading will now fire at the start of \n  initComponent and ClientLoaded at the end of initComponent. ClientLoading should be used for Ext.override calls, \n  ClientLoaded should be called for adding actions, UI elements.\n\n- **Fixed:** IE11 on touch laptops were detected as a mobile device so Document Viewer was displayed in mobile mode. \n  Improved mobile device detection to prevent this kind of issues.\n\n- **Improved:** Document Viewer. Some formats (e.g. common image formats and digital paper formats like XPS and EPUB) \n  will be opened faster for first-time view. More formats can be viewed with Document Viewer.\n\n- **Improved:** Updated Media Player. Also updated the skin to youtube style.\n\n- **Improved:** Image and document caches will now group cached files for the same inputs in subfolders. \n  Also the subfolder name  will contain the original file name so it will be easier to locate the corresponding cached \n  files for an input. The old cached files will be arranged into the new structure automatically one by one when they \n  are accessed so no action is required for the developer.",
