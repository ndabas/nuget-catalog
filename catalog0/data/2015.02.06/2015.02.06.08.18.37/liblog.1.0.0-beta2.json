  "description": "If you are a library or framework author and you wish to provid logging support to your component there are a couple of options 1) Depend on Log4Net/NLog 2) Depend on Common.Logging 3) Implement your own ILog interface and make your consumers wire it up.\n\nOption 1 is not desirable because it forces your users to use a particular framework. Option 2 is not desirable because it will add yet more nuger package dependencies and project references with associated versioning concerns and requires wiring up with. Option 3 is desirable because it is dependency free but requires that your users to remember to write an adapter and wire things up.\n\nThis package is a version of option 3:\n- It will add an ILog, ILogProvider etc to YourRootNamespace.Logging\n- ILog is 2 methods to implement in comparision to Common.Logging ILog's ~65 members\n- Using reflection, it transparently supports NLog and Log4Net without any wiring up required by an end user.",
