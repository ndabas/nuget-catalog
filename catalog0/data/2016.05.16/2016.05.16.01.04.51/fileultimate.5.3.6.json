  "releaseNotes": "Version 5.3.6 - May 16, 2016\n- Fixed: Moving a folder which had files at second and higher level depth failed.\n- Fixed: FileManagerRootFolder.GetFolder was broken when the root folder had no access control.\n- Added: TotalSize, ElapsedTime and TransferRate properties to FileManagerDownloadedEventArgs so that more information\n  will be available in Downloaded event.\n- Improved: Updated media player, document conversion, graphics and video engines.\n\nVersion 5.3.5 - May 10, 2016\n- Fixed: Some problems continued on Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge browsers after the new drag and drop feature.\n  For example, columns on the file list were not clickable anymore. With this version all problems related to clicking\n  should be fixed and clicking should feel more responsive again.\n- Fixed: Some UI quirks. For example error window was still displaying behind the background mask on some cases and  \n  minimize/restore state of a window was not stable (scrolling the main view behind the window caused it the window\n  to minimize).\n- Improved: Made the default action of dragged items \"Move to\" even if the drag is made across view (eg. dragging from \n  main view to folder tree). So \"Copy to\" action will be switched on only if CTRL key is pressed. This exactly mimics \n  \"Windows Explorer\" behaviour.\n- Fixed: After you drag and drop in the folder tree, you could get an error message when you clicked the parent folder.\n  When dragging, the tree was confused and changed the current selection to the dragged one (focused) although this was \n  not visually reflected so we had a ghost selection.  \n- Fixed: Prevented horizontal scroll of folder tree when dragging on the right edge and waiting for 500ms. The scroll helper\n  should only work vertically for the folder tree.\n- Fixed: While dragging on the bottom of the main view or folder tree, the page would flicker.\n- Improved: Updated PDF icon with the most recent one. Also fixed large icons for ascx, ashx, asmx, aspx, config, css, htm, \n  js, resx, xsd, xsl, xml, h extensions so they will not be pixelated (upsized from small icon).\n- Fixed: Icons for 1 letter extensions were not shown (eg. .c and .h), also \"Type\" column showed \"File\" instead of e.g.\n  \"C File\".\n- Added: Wildcard support for FileManagerAccessControl.Path property. Now you can use these wildcards in a path: \n  The ? wildcard character matches a single character.\n  The * wildcard character matches zero or more characters.\n  The ** wildcard character sequence matches a partial path.\n  For example, if you set Path=\"\\**\\*MatchMe*\", this access control will appy to the folders containing MatchMe keyword\n  in name under both root folder and under root folder's all subfolders (recursive).\n    \nVersion 5.3.1 - May 9, 2016\n- Fixed: Clicking and selecting folders was broken due to new drag and drop feature on Internet Explorer and \n  Microsoft Edge browsers. Other browsers like Chrome and Firefox did not have this problem.\n- Fixed: Thumbnail images were being dragged instead of the item on Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge browsers.\n\nVersion 5.3.0 - May 9, 2016\n- Added: Drag and drop feature with \"Copy to\" and \"Move to\" actions. Drag and drop works just like \"Windows Explorer\" \n  both visually and functionality-wise including the modifier keys, i.e. during dragging pressing CTRL key will force \n  \"Copy to\", pressing SHIFT key will force \"Move to\" and pressing ESC key will cancel the drag.\n- Fixed: \"Paste\" action was not displayed when right clicked on a folder on the right side (main view not the folder tree \n  on the left)\n- Fixed: Close icon of a child window required multiple clicks on some occasions to close the window.\n- Fixed: In the folder tree, when pasted into a collapsed folder, it was not expanded although it's icon showed as \n  expanded state (down arrow)\n- Fixed: When an error window was displayed, occasionally it was displayed behind the background mask, so it was not\n  possible to close the window unless you pressed ESC key.",
