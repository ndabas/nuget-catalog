In fact the developers were even facing a legal suit against it. Players who have been playing the game before 2016 might be aware of another currency that existed in the game back then Tix. If you are wondering what it is here is all you need to know about it.\nA good year or so I wrote an article called ‘What is Trivia Bowl Buzzer Full’.
