  "description": "Feature summary:\n.  Small and simple to use and understand.\n.  Single file reference needed.\n.  Full object hierarchy CRUD support. Saves all object properties and the relationships to related tables. Also supports collection properties.\n.  Allows developers to write sql as needed for reads. The design just maps the results to the objects. Writes are tightly coupled to the database and build on primary key constraints.\n.  No inheritance requirements, uses either interface implementation or attributes.\n.  Allows developers to modify the relation sql to further optimize loading of children.\n.  Sql Server bulk insert support.\n.  Lazy initialization support, with child sql override.\n.  Change trackng support to history tables.\n.  Supported databases: Sql Server / Express / Local DB, My Sql, Sqlite, Oracle, PostgreSql.\n. Built-in Performance tracking, implement IPerformanceTracking to allow performance tracking of all database actions.\n. Optimistic concurrency support.\n. No configuration files needed.\n. Trace output of SQL statements and parameter values.\n. Password one way hashing support.\n. Field level encryption with auto decrypt upon load ability.\n. Processing intercept support, BeforeInsert, BeforeUpdate, BeforeDelete, AfterLoad.",

  "releaseNotes": "Version: 4.0.3.0\n\n31-Mar-2014\nStarted working on support for PostgreSql.\nResearching support for Firebird database.\n\n02-Apr-2014\nCreates are working for flat and hierarchical objects using PostgreSql database.\n\n04-Apr-2014\nKeep getting time-out exception when trying to open a connection. Not using all 100 connections, so doing some research.\nTried turning on the NpgsqlEventLog to see DB provider logs, seems to crash the Unit tests, just stops running.\nPostgreSql doesn't seem to handle connections, pooling as well as other databases.\n\n05-Apr-2014\nSeems the ORM is not closing all the connections when a exception happens.\nThe Unit tests perform concurrency tests which generated expected concurrency errors, \nthis creates many exceptions and the connections were not closed.\n\nI'm sure the garbage collector will get to them, but apparently it's not quick enough for PostgreSql.\n  \nCases during exceptions are now closing the connections.\n\nAll tests passed for PostgreSql database.\n\nChange IDatabaseTypesFactory to include another new method: ObtainConnectionStringFromConfig",
