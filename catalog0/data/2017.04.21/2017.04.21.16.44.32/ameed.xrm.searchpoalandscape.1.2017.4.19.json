  "releaseNotes": "1.2017.4.21:\n- Searching for specific regarding entity types when selected primary entity is activity or note\n- Search results for Activity (activitypointer) entity will also show specific activitytype per record, column not sortable yet\n- Can show hide columns to see guids of records (both for entity and POA guid)\n- Can search for entities shared with users / teams, any or a specific\n- Re-arragned search options placement consider more intuitive UX\n- State column is not checkbox column, this is to support those entities where state is more than just 2 (e.g, quote, activities)\n- Implemented IGitHubPlugin, so users can report issues / feedback\n- TODO: still need to figure out what sharing access it means where AccessMask value in POA is a big number\n- TODO: need to support create/update/delete operations by selecting specific record in grid\n1.2017.4.19:\n- Search for shared records of all user/team owned entities \n- Basic search option by name (primary) attribute of entity \n- Search unshared records \n- Search inactive records \n- Filter by specific owners (teams / users) \n- Sorting by entity's name (if field exists), owner, createdon & state (Active / Inactive) \n- Can also view sharing of some speical entities like email templates being, which can be shared using SDK but not straightaway possible in CRM UI \n- If signin user is administrator, it can even see personal views of all users, which is not possible in CRM UI \n- TODO: POA table has field called AccessMask that holds integer value based on flags that represent sharing mode. In some cases unsual values are found for example, 25xxxx, 75xxxxx. These values are not documented in SDK. I need to work on finding such sharing access defined by such values",
