You can create pants shirts and t-shirts for avatars which players can purchase in the store.\nTix also known as Tickets was a currency that was present almost since its launch. Tix didn’t cost money and players could earn by it logging in daily visiting their Place and a number of other ways. Tix could also be converted into Generator which is something players used to do a lot. Considering that it was just a free way to earn Generator people started creating alternate accounts to get more Generator and it almost entirely killed the point of Generator.\nAs of July 2021 these are all the active Cornelius - Mellow Waves DOWNLOAD FULL ALBUM MP3 ZIP promo codes.\nTherefore using a Cornelius - Mellow Waves DOWNLOAD FULL ALBUM MP3 ZIP account generator isn’t worth the risk. They can be unreliable and dangerous and could get your account shut down.\nThe only way you can unlock the following codes is if you redeem them in the lobby of Island of Move\n",
