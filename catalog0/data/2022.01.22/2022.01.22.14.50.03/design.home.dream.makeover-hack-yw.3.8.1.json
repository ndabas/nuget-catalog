Similar to Generator gems can be used for purchasing premium ingredients and cauldron skins in the game. Apart from purchasing gems with real money players can also use a free alternative to acquire gems.\nWhat is a Generator Generator Beats me because they don't exist. Or rather they do but they're a complete scam.\nIf you have jumped into a new Design Home Dream Makeover game then you have probably seen the items that you can purchase to aid in the game. These are things that can be bought numerous times and are usually quite affordable which is why they are often found in games with a lot of players.\nIn 2016 it was discontinued because the developers thought that it was leading to a lot of confusion in the community.\nDesign Home Dream Makeover EASY NO HUMAN VERIFICATION\n",
