Then Splitgate suddenly blew up in popularity in July of this year getting a massive influx of new players that forced developer 1047 Games to continuously upgrade their servers just to keep up with the demand.\nIn the box that says ‘Enter Your Code’ players should input the code they are trying to redeem. If entering the code is followed by a green thumbs-up the redemption was successful and the items should be in the player's inventory. If entering the code is followed by a red thumbs-down icon the code is invalid meaning it is likely expired or has already been redeemed.\nThe most lucrative (and most difficult) way to make Generator in Pick Me Up is to create your own game and monetize it in a number of different ways. Games that offer special upgrades premium services completely unique items and include advertisements tend to make a ton of money.\n",
