You‚Äôve come to the right place. This valuable currency allows you to purchase the wide variety of cosmetics on offer, allowing you to show off your prowess (or how much you‚Äôve spent) during matches. You can get fancy character outfits, individual items of clothing, vehicles, weapons, and more. Some of them even glow. Nice.\n\nWhile you can earn the odd Garena Free Fire diamond for free, it‚Äôs not easy, and the amount you earn is often far lower than from other sources, like just outright purchasing it. It‚Äôs usually limited to events though.
