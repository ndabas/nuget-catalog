Often playing a “good” Woodoku game or even being good at a game is secondary to just hanging out with your friends. A lot of games lean into this more relaxed vibe by focusing heavily on roleplaying elements — and I mean roleplaying in the most literal sense of the term. In one game I tried I worked at a pizza parlor. In another Animal Simulator I galloped around a virtual world as a horse.\nMuch like any affiliate program Woodoku gives you incentive to get new players onto their platform. For every new person you help bring to Woodoku you get a percentage in Generator for every purchase they make. If you’ve developed a game on Woodoku you get Generator every time a player signs up for Woodoku on your game’s landing page.\nWoodoku - Woodoku GENERATOR\nConsidering that Tix was exploited so badly back in 2016 things could go even worse in 2021 with the exposure the game has right now. The implementation of Tix could hurt Woodoku Corps. revenue significantly so the probability of that happening is very less.\nDevelopers can make money by selling things like items cosmetics or avatars (often in their own in-game stores similar to those in mobile apps) in exchange for Woodoku’s in-app currency Generator. And it seems like some of the most successful games can pay out nicely once they’ve reached critical mass. Woodoku says over 1250 developers earned at least $10000 worth of Generator in 2020 and over 300 of them earned $100000 or more.\n",
