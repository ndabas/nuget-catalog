  "description": "Provides a class and a few extension methods to facilitate common operations with values that may or may not exist.\n\nTraditionally, programmers often use `null` references to represent values that \"aren't there\", but the problem is that this was never their intended purpose. \n\n- Languages like C# don't provide a way to differentiate between reference variables that can be null and those that are guaranteed not to be.\n- The inventor of null references has [apologized](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Hoare#Quotations) for creating them in the first place, calling them his \"billion-dollar mistake.\"\n- This misuse of null references has spread far and wide, leading to the unfortunately-named `Nullable<>` type (which, being a value type, is never actually null), and attributes like `[CanBeNull]` and `[NotNull]` to help programmers know when they can expect a method to treat a null value as legitimate input.\n\nAll this leaves us in a position where our best hope of avoiding `NullReferenceException`s lies in trying to make sure that our reference variables are *never* null. But in that case, how do we indicate when a value is *optional*?\n\nWell, that's where `Maybe<>` comes in.",
