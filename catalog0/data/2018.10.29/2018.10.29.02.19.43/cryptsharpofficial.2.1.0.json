  "description": "CryptSharp provides a number of password crypt algorithms - BCrypt, LDAP, MD5 (and Apache's htpasswd variant), PHPass (WordPress, phpBB, Drupal), SHA256, SHA512, and Traditional and Extended DES. Additionally it includes Blowfish, SCrypt, and PBKDF2 for any HMAC (.NET's built-in PBKDF2 implementation supports only SHA-1). If you are looking to store passwords, odds are CryptSharp has the algorithm you want.",

  "releaseNotes": "2.1.0 (December 2, 2014):\n  Added SHA256, SHA384, and SHA512 LDAP schemes.\n  Fixed Drupal 7+ crypt.\n  \n2.0.0 (May 8, 2013):\n  Documentation! The meaning of methods, no longer a mystery...\n  \n  Crypt features:\n  Added support for the 2x and 2y Blowfish prefixes.\n  Added LDAP schemes such as Apache htpasswd's {SHA}.\n  Added MD5 crypt and the Apache htpasswd variant.\n  Added PHPass crypt, as seen in WordPress. Variants for phpBB and Drupal 7+ are also included.\n  Added SHA256 and SHA512 crypt, as seen in Linux.\n  Added Traditional and Extended DES crypt for completeness's sake.\n  CryptSharp is now feature-complete for common crypt and htpasswd methods.\n  \n  Utilities:\n  BaseEncoding performs generic binary-to-text encoding.\n  Made the Pbkdf2 class easier to use.\n  Optimized the SCrypt code. It is now 50% faster.\n  SecureComparison implements timing-insensitive string comparison.\n  \n  Miscellaneous:\n  I now code-sign the CryptSharp DLL so you can confirm it is unaltered.\n\n1.2.0 (January 23, 2011):\n  The SCrypt KDF is now supported as CryptSharp.Utility.SCrypt.\n  Added djb's Salsa20, required by SCrypt.\n  \n1.1.1 (January 22, 2011):\n  BCrypt can now use magic strings other than the default.\n  \n1.1.0 (January 21, 2011):\n\tAdded a PBKDF2 implementation that can run against arbitrary HMACs. I will use this for SCrypt support soon.\n\tThe BCrypt password length limit was needlessly short. It is now fully compatible with PHP crypt.\n\tThe demo now checks Blowfish and PBKDF2 (SHA1) against official test vectors.\n\tThe demo also checks BCrypt against 400 crypts length 0-100 randomly generated with PHP.\n\n1.0.0 (November 7, 2010):\n\tInitial release.\n\t\nIf you have any questions, comments, or run into any problems, don't hesitate to send me an e-mail at jfb@zer7.com or visit the CryptSharp website at http://www.zer7.com/software/cryptsharp\n\nThanks and enjoy the library!\n\nJames",
