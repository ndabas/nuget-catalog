  "description": "ImageUltimate is the fastest and easiest ASP.NET image resizer which supports both ASP.NET MVC and ASP.NET WebForms web applications/web sites. ImageUltimate can also be used with .NET desktop applications as web specific features are separated into Web sub-namespace.\n \n    \nFeatures:\n\n- Provides a fluent interface for easily chaining image manipulation commands.\n\n- Processes images stripe by stripe so avoids keeping a full sized bitmap in RAM. This means minimal memory usage and the ability to process very large images in a fast manner.\n\n- Vastly faster (10x) than System.Drawing namespace and optimized specifically for web use.\n\n- Can load these image file formats: Jpeg, Png, Gif, WebP, Bmp, Tiff, Eps, Psd, Raw\n\n- Can save these image file formats: Jpeg, Png, Gif, WebP, Bmp, Tiff, Eps, Pdf\n\n- Provides detailed information about an image file like format, size, DPI, pixel format and metadata like EXIF and IPTC.\n\n- Provides these image transforms: Resize, ResizeWidth, ResizeHeight, Crop, CropBorders, Rotate, Flip\n\n- Provides these image color and tone corrections: Brightness, BrightnessAuto, Contrast, ContrastAuto, BrightnessContrast\n\n- Caches generated images both on server and browser with a smart versioning algorithm. A unique and browser-cacheable url is generated according to the chained commands and whenever you change these commands (or modify the source image externally), the url will vary and this will cause browser to automatically detect changes (no need to press F5).\n\n- Generates SEO friendly urls. By default the file name of the source image is used but it's possible to override this file name for SEO purposes.\n\n- Single DLL for easy deployment and no dependencies. No messy Web.config settings. Just drop it in your bin folder and you are ready to go.\n\n- Strongly-typed API for web, no need to learn and memorize messy url querystring parameters, just chain commands with the help of intellisense.\n    \n    \nASP.NET MVC usage examples:\n\n    @Html.Image(\"Image1.jpg\", task => task.ResizeWidth(300))\n    @Html.Image(\"Image2.png\", task => task.ResizeHeight(300).Rotate(45))\n    @Html.Image(\"Image3.jpg\", task => task.Flip(FlipMode.Vertical), new { alt = \"description\"})\n    @Html.Image(\"Image4.jpg\", task => task.Brightness(50).FileName(\"seo-name\"))\n    Image url: @Url.Image(\"Image5.jpg\", task => task.Crop(0, 0, 100, 100).Format(ImageSaveFormat.Png))\n\n\nASP.NET WebForms usage examples:\n\n    <%=Page.ImageHtml(\"Image1.jpg\", task => task.ResizeWidth(300)) %>\n    <%=Page.ImageHtml(\"Image3.jpg\", task => task.Flip(FlipMode.Vertical), new { alt = \"description\"}) %>\n    Image url: <%=Page.ImageUrl(\"Image1.jpg\", task => task.Contrast(-20)) %>\n\n\nGeneral usage examples:\n\n    using (var imageTask = new ImageTask(@\"C:\\Pictures\\Picture1.jpg\"))\n        imageTask.ResizeWidth(200).Save(@\"C:\\Output\\Picture2.jpg\");\n\n\n    using (var imageTask = new ImageTask(@\"C:\\Pictures\\Picture1.jpg\"))\n        imageTask\n        .ResizeWidth(200).Save(@\"C:\\Output\\Picture2.jpg\")\n        .Undo().ResizeHeight(400).Rotate(90).Save(@\"C:\\Output\\Picture3.png\")\n        .UndoAll().Save(outputStream, ImageSaveFormat.Pdf);\n\n\nNote: This package contains a fully working version of the product, however without a license key it will run in trial mode. This  means after 30 days, the generated images will be watermarked with a red \"ImageUltimate\" text at the bottom right corner.",
