The comparison doesn't take into account unique identifier values, e.g. SlideId and dynamic content, e.g. current date value in Date Placeholder.\n\nExample code snippet:\n\nusing(Presentation presentation1 = new Presentation(@\"SomePresentation1.pptx\"))\nusing(Presentation presentation2 = new Presentation(@\"SomePresentation2.pptx\"))\n{\n  for (int i = 0; i < presentation1.Masters.Count; i++)\n  {\n    for (int j = 0; j < presentation2.Masters.Count; j++)\n    {\n      if (presentation1.Masters[i].Equals(presentation2.Masters[j]))\n        Console.WriteLine(string.Format(\"SomePresentation1 MasterSlide#{0} is equal to SomePresentation2 MasterSlide#{1}\", i, j));\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nIsMergedCell property has been added to ICell interface and Cell classICell.\n\nIsMergedCell property returns true if the cell is merged with any adjusted cell, false otherwise. It can be used to identify merged cells across the table.\n\nCode snippet for output all merged cells in a table:\n\nusing(Presentation pres = new Presentation(\"SomePresentationWithTable.pptx\"))\n{\n  ITable table = pres.Slides[0].Shapes[0] as ITable; // assuming that Slide#0.Shape#0 is a table\n  for (int i = 0; i < table.Rows.Count; i++)\n  {\n    for (int j = 0; j < table.Columns.Count; j++)\n    {\n      ICell currentCell = table.Rows[i][j];\n      if (currentCell.IsMergedCell)\n      {\n        Console.WriteLine(string.Format(\"Cell {0};{1} is a part of merged cell with RowSpan={2} and ColSpan={3} starting from Cell {4};{5}.\",\n          i, j, currentCell.RowSpan, currentCell.ColSpan, \n          currentCell.FirstRowIndex, currentCell.FirstColumnIndex));\n      }\n    } \n  }\n}",
