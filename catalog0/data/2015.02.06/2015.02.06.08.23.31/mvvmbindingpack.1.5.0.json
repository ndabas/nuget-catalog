  "description": "MvvmBindingPack is the robust platform for UX high-quality design solutions including of using IoC containers.\n MVVM pattern is widely used in developing of XAML-based GUI applications. It is impossible to provide the quality UX design implementations without using this pattern. Quality of UX design directly depends on the techniques or features that used for implementing the MVVM pattern. Clear separation of concerns between View (XAML code coupled with its code-behind) and View Model characterizes a profession level and quality of the product implementation \nDigital agencies are often involved in providing the quality UX design solutions for application products. This process is based on separated development of the application. Design agency develops View (XAML) part and Technology or Business Company concentrates on developing functional parts: View Model and Model.\nWell known Binding markup extension can bind only two properties together. The source property can be located either in Resources or either in XAML code-behind. These standard framework features donâ€™t allow developers to separate View from View Model. The volume of code behind development dumps quality of GUI; it increases complicity and cost of maintainability. Change in View can cause the dramatic and messy changes of the code behind layer. \nFor high quality UX implementation with XAML you need separate or, by other words, bind XAML by using ICommand, RouteEventHandler and other WPF handlers with View Model.",
