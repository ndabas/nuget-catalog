  "releaseNotes": "This is a major release with several improvements, bug fixes and breaking changes due to severe refactoring prior to version 2.0.50727.1433 (file version <= 2.2.2013.2731). This is the result of the fact that I am maturing the Cuemon family to go open source while working hard on having a production ready version of the Cuemon.ServiceModel assembly.\nThe following work was completed for this release:\n\n- A new static class was introduced in the Cuemon namespace; AssemblyUtility that was designed to make common Assembly related operations easier to work with\n- A new static class was introduced in the Cuemon namespace; DelegateUtility that was designed to make common delegate operations easier to work with\n- A new static class was introduced in the Cuemon.Diagnostics namespace; InstrumentationUtility that provides a way to diagnostic, monitor and measure performance through Act and Doer{TResult} delegate overloads\n- A new static class was introduced in the Cuemon.Web namespace; MimeUtility that was designed to make Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) related operations easier to work with\n\n- The Action delegate was renamed to Act (breaking)\n- The Func delegate was renamed to Doer (breaking)\n- The FuncOut delegate was renamed to TesterDoer (breaking)\n- The ActionFactory was renamed to ActFactory (breaking)\n- The FuncFactory was renamed to DoerFactory (breaking)\n- The ActionWorkItem was renamed to ActWorkItem (breaking)\n- The ActionWorkItemPool was renamed to ActWorkItemPool (breaking)\n- The FuncWorkItem was renamed to DoerWorkItem (breaking)\n- The FuncWorkItemPool was renamed to DoerWorkItemPool (breaking)\n- The SortedFuncWorkItem was renamed to SortedDoerWorkItem (breaking)\n- The SortedFuncWorkItemPool was renamed to SortedDoerWorkItemPool (breaking)\n- The IActionWorkItem was renamed to IActWorkItem (breaking)\n- The IActionWorkItemPool was renamed to IActWorkItemPool (breaking)\n- The IFuncWorkItem was renamed to IDoerWorkItem (breaking)\n- The IFuncWorkItemPool was renamed to IDoerWorkItemPool (breaking)\n- The ISortedFuncWorkItem was renamed to ISortedDoerWorkItem (breaking)\n- The ISortedFuncWorkItemPool was renamed to ISortedDoerWorkItemPool (breaking)\n\n- The AssemblyUtility class was born with one method; GetCacheValidator\n- The DelegateUtility class was born with one method; Wrap\n- The FileUtility class was extended with a new method; GetCacheValidator\n- The LucidInstrumentation class was deprecated and removed in favour of the new InstrumentationUtility\n- The CacheValidator class now supports a ReferencePoint based on a given Assembly\n- The GlobalModule class was futher strengthened for maintainability while continuing to support peaceful coexistence with Windows Communication Foundation\n- The Endpoint class was extended with methods and supporting attributes that will greatly help built solid and resilient service endpoints; among those is worth mentioning ExecuteAction, ExecuteFunction, HttpCachingAttribute and HttpResponseAttribute\n\nNote: this version has a breaking change from assembly version 2.0.50727.1433 to 2.5.2013.2800. This was done because of the many new improvements since the 2.0.50727.1433 version.",
