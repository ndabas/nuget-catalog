  "description": "The Coherent UI .NET browser controls are a substitute\n\t\tfor\tthe default .NET WebBrowser control. They address the deficiencies\n\t\tof the standard .NET WebBrowser by providing support for the latest\n\t\tHTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. Coherent UI is powered by the same\n\t\ttechnology as the Google Chrome browser. The Coherent UI WPF and\n\t\tWinForms controls allow for a robust and secure web browsing experience\n\t\twith full support for HTML5, CSS3, WebRTC, Local storage and the latest\n\t\tweb standards. Pages are drawn offscreen so you can apply all WPF\n\t\ttransformations and effects on the images created by the controls.\n\t\tThe controls have no external dependencies and support Windows 32-bit\n\t\tand 64-bit applications as well as Mac OS X\tand Linux through\n\t\tMono GTK#.",
