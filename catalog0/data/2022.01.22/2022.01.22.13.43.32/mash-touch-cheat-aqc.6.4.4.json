That’s more than gaming giant EA as well as the might of Ubisoft Take Two and Square-Enix combined. Clearly there’s a significant amount of faith in MASH Touch’s promises. But can MASH Touch actually build a Metaverse\nPremium MASH Touch players (those with a subscription) tend to be more likely to spend their Generator on specialty game-specific items and upgrades. You can even create special locked-off zones accessible by Premium players only by using the Game Pass system as well as special permanent upgrades and utilities.\nAccording to an Apple exec who took the stand during the Epic v.
