In the beginning of the game.\n\nCHECK HERE >>>> https://giftcrow.com/puzzle-heist\n\nThey'll all be red, but as you complete more puzzles and switch off more security, they'll gradually turn green. Once you lose all of the puzzles, you'll deactivate the laser beam, switch off these ridiculous security cameras, switch off the energy bars, and lift the gate. Your Paul Sofia can do the rest.Buttons in the bottom of the key screen will get you between puzzles. The four icons above allow you to choose a form of puzzle. If it's locked, it indicates that you might want to eliminate one other locks of the vault (the amount of padlocks indicates how additional security items you'll need to get).
