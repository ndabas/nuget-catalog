  "description": "If you like the structure of the .NET platform, then the Cuemon .NET Framework Additions might just be that extra solution you have been looking for! With these assemblies I have aimed to accomplish at least two things; simplify the tedious work that is always present when coding towards a generic framework, and implementing some core- and utility classes for you to enjoy.",

  "releaseNotes": "For two month this major release has been under way - and there are still so much work to be done, but slow and steady a cloud friendly framework is emerging with the guts to remove deprecated code while keeping a focus on performance and high flexibility using Action and Func delegates where appropriate. My Achilles heel is still the Cuemon.ServiceModel class, but the ground work is in place and I expect within 3 months that a REST friendly and highly flexible solution is in place.\nEnough with the small talk - let’s get to the work that was implemented for 2.0.2013.1000:\n\n- The Func delegate was extended from 5 arguments to 20 arguments\n- The Action delegate was extended from 5 arguments to 20 arguments\n\n- A new utility class was introduced in the Cuemon namespace; TransientFaultUtility that provides ways to make applications more resilient with robust transient fault handling logic \n- A new class was introduced in the Cuemon namespace; TransientFaultException\n- A new class was introduced in the Cuemon namespace; DefaultOr that provides - to some extent - a generic way to support the Null Object Pattern\n- A new class was introduced in the Cuemon namespace; Wrapper -> IWrapper\n- A new class was introduced to ease the usage of Func delegates; the FuncFactory class with up to 20 arguments\n- A new class was introduced to ease the usage of Action delegates; the ActionFactory class with up to 20 arguments\n- A new class was introduced in the Cuemon namespace; LoopUtility\n- A new class was introduced in the Cuemon namespace; Hierarchy -> IHierarchy as well as HierarchyUtility\n- A new class was introduced in the Cuemon namespace; AssignmentUtility\n- A new enum was introduced in the Cuemon namespace; AssignmentOperator\n- A new enum was introduced in the Cuemon namespace; RelationalOperator\n- The HashUtility class was extended to support the CRC32 checksum\n- The MethodSignature class was extended with these new members; HasParameters, Create, MergeParameters\n- The Instrumentation class was simplified internally\n- The TypeUtility class was extended with these new methods; GetAncestorOrSelf, IsEnumerable, IsDictionary, IsKeyValuePair, SanitizeTypeName, ContainsAttributeType\n- The ExceptionUtility class was refactored, moved and extended with these new methods; Parse, Flatten, Refine [breaking]\n- The TesterDoerUtility class was refactored to support both Action and Func delegates [breaking]\n- The HttpMethod enum was renamed to HttpMethods as it now supports the Flags attribute [breaking]\n- The StringUtility class was extended with these new methods; Remove\n- The ConvertUtility class received optimizations and was extended with these new methods; ToWebHeaderCollection, ToString, ToEnumerable, ToDelimitedString\n- The ReflectionUtility class was extended with these new methods; GetAttributes, GetAttribute, HasCircularReference, GetPropertyValue, GetObjectHierarchy\n\n- A new class was introduced in the Cuemon.Security.Cryptography namespace; CyclicRedundancyCheck32\n- A new abstract class was introduced in the Cuemon.Security.Cryptography namespace; CyclicRedundancyCheck\n- A new enum was introduced in the Cuemon.Security.Cryptography namespace; PolynomialRepresentation\n\n- A new utility class was introduced in the Cuemon.Collections.Generic namespace; ListUtility\n- A new utility class was introduced in the Cuemon namespace; EnumUtility with so far one method: HasFlags\n- A new class was introduced in the Cuemon.Collections.Generic namespace; EnumerableSizeComparer\n- The EnumerableUtility class was extended with several new methods; Select, SelectMany, FindAll, Any\n\n- A new enum was introduced in the Cuemon.Xml.Serialization namespace; SerializableOrder\n- The XmlUtility class has its ConvertEncoding method extended\n- The XmlConvertUtility class was extended with these new methods; ToXmlElement, ToStream [breaking]\n- The XmlSerializationUtility class completely revamped, refactored and simplified with a high degree of flexibility [breaking]\n- The XmlSerialization class was extended with several new overloads of ToXml\n\n- The DataManager, SqlDataManager and SqlCeDataManager class was refactored to use the new TransientFaultUtility class with accordingly name aligning [breaking]\n- The RuntimeBusinessEntity class was extended to provide better exception details\n- The DataManager class received a bug fix for those rare occasions where an exception is thrown while iterating a reader or similar; command parameters are cleared now\n- The ColumnAttribute class now supports ordering of compound primary keys\n- The BusinessEntityDataAdapter now support multiple steps in property hierarchy\n- The MappingUtility class was extended with the new methods; ParseStorageFieldValue, SetStorageFieldPropertyValue, ParseStorageField\n- The BusinessEntity class now supports multiple steps in property hierarchy\n- The BusinessEntityUtility class now fully supports compound primary keys\n\n- The XsltPage now supports entity tag resolvement when checking against client caching\n- The GlobalModule class was simplified internally\n- The HttpResponseFilter class was simplified internally\n- The HttpResponseContentFilter class was extended and simplified internally\n- The HttpResponseUtility class was refactored and extended with these new methods; SetClientSideContentCacheExpiresHeaders, CreateClientSideContentCacheExpiresHeaders [breaking]\n- The HttpRequestUtility class was refactored and extended with these new methods; IsClientSideContentCached, TryGetEntityTagHeader [breaking]\n- The SiteMapProtocolHandler was refactored to use the NetHttpUtility class\n\n- The Cuemon.ServiceModel assembly is a work in progress why it is not recommended to use any classes but the Endpoint base class although many have been added\n\nHappy coding - it was with a high degree of pride that this release is made possible!",
