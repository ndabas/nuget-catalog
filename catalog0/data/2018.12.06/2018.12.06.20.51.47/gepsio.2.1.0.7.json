  "description": "Gepsio is a .NET-based document object model for XBRL documents. Load your XBRL document with the XbrlDocument class and work with your XBRL document exposed as a set of .NET classes with a variety of properties and methods. Loaded XBRL documents are automatically validated against the information against the XBRL specification, and exceptions are thrown when invalid XBRL documents are loaded. The Gepsio code base is unit tested using the XBRL-CONF-CR3-2007-03-05 unit tests designed by the XBRL organization.",

  "releaseNotes": "The Sep 2013 CTP offers two high-level improvements from the previous CTP:\n\n1.Dramatically Improved Load Times: Calls to XbrlDocument.Load() for large, real-world XBRL instances will enjoy a dramatic decrease in execution times, thanks to a series of patches that turn some of the internal lists, and associated linear lookups, to dictionaries that use more efficient lookup methods during document validations. XBRL instances that were taking more than 20 seconds to load now load in about eight seconds, and more load time improvements are planned!\n\n2.New Design For Reporting Document Validity: The XbrlException method used in previous CTPs to report document validation errors has been replaced with a new XbrlDocument property called IsValid as well as an XbrlDocument collection called ValidationErrors that will report on all of the validation errors found in an XBRL instance. The blog post at http://gepsio.wordpress.com/2013/06/07/new-document-validation-design-shipping-in-next-ctp/ contains detailed information on this new design.",
