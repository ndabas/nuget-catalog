  "description": "Our API delivers outstanding value to developers through four pillars: simplicity, affordability, accuracy, and speed. \n\nSimplicity - With SLOC at a fraction of open source solutions, the Manatee Works Barcode Scanner SDK lets developers forgo a steep learning curve and focus on application development. \n\nAffordability - Given multiple licensing choices, one-time payment options, rolling device licensing, NO network connectivity requirements, and NO long-term commitments, Manatee Works' decoders are more affordable, reliable, and easy to license than our commercial competitors.\n\nAccuracy - While most decoders only work well with high quality barcode images, Manatee Works' decoders are tuned to read the densest barcode images even under challenging conditions of low light, extreme angles, varying brightness and contrast levels, and inverted surfaces.\n\nSpeed - The algorithms in our software achieve exceptional barcode-scanning performance and read range under a variety of lighting conditions, even with damaged barcodes. Welcome to the new breed of industrial scanners. \n\nThe Manatee Works Barcode Scanner SDK library supports all major barcode symbologies, including Aztec Code, Codabar, Code 11, Code 25 (Interleaved, Industrial and ITF-14), Code 39, Code 93, Code 128, Data Matrix, DotCode, EAN, ISBN, GS1 Databar, MaxiCode, MSI Plessey, PDF417, Postal Code, QR Code (Micro and Standard), and UPC barcode types, as well as all GS1 specific sub types like GS1 QR Code, GS1 DataMatrix and GS1-128.\n\nYou can add powerful software plugins to the Manatee Works Barcode Scanner SDK at no additional cost when you purchase an SDK license. Plugins include industry standard parsers (AAMVA, GS1, IUID, Structured Carrier Messages, and more!), scan metrics, or the Aimer Plugin software.\n\nPut us to the test in your real-world conditions and use cases.\n\nTo learn more, contact us via email at sales@manateeworks.com or visit www.manateeworks.com.",
