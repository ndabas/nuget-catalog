  "releaseNotes": "This is a minor release with medium risk of backfiring; many core classes received planned refactoring.\nThe following work was completed for this release:\n\n- A new class was introduced in the Cuemon.Diagnostics namespace; LucidInstrumentation that is a lucid implementation of the Instrumentation class that favors diagnostics, monitoring and measuring performance through Action and Func{TResult} overloads\n- A new class was introduced in the Cuemon.IO namespace; FileMapping that represents the mapping information that is needed to associate a given file extension with a content-type and vice-versa.\n- A new class was introduced with the previous release in the Cuemon namespace; EventArgs that provides generic data for an event\n\n- The StringUtility class was extended with a new method; Count\n- The CacheChecksum enum had its Aggregated value changed to Combined\n- The Dependency class was refactored to avoid the need for the Disposable pattern\n- The IDependency interface was refactored to not inherit from the IDisposable interface\n- The Cache class was refactored to reflect the changes in the Dependency base class\n- The CacheDictionary class was refactored to better avoid long lasting thread synchronization\n- The FileDependency class was refactored to align the logic of the built-in FileSystemWatcher class and to reflect the changes in the Dependency base class\n- The NetDependency class was refactored to reflect the changes in the Dependency base class\n\n- The DataDependency class was refactored to reflect the changes in the Dependency base class\n\n- The HttpRequestUtility class was extended with a new method; IsServerLocal\n- The HttpResponseContentFilter class was refactored to better detect when usage is needed\n- The HttpResponseCompressionFilter was deprecated and removed\n- The HttpRoute class now implements the IData interface\n- The HttpRoutePath was extended with a new property; PhysicalFileMimeType\n- The HttpRouteTable class received a new overload of TryParse\n- The HttpFastSessionState received a bug fix in its GetEnumerator method\n- The XsltMasterPage was refactored with alignment to XsltPage, updated internal caching and better usage of the recent introduced CacheValidator class\n- The XsltPage was refactored with alignment to XsltMasterPage, updated internal caching, better usage of the recent introduced CacheValidator class and to reflect the changes in the FileDependency class\n- The XsltPageLocalizationPhraseCollection class was refactored to reflect the changes in the FileDependency class\n- The GlobalModule class was refactored to be more performance friendly, to take better advantage of the recent introduced CacheValidator class, to inherit from LucidInstrumentation instead of Instrumentation, to handle compression more elegant while opening up for temp. caching of compressed static files (saves CPU), Url routing was moved to a virtual method; HandleUrlRouting\n- The WebConfigurationUtility class was refactored to reflect the changes in the FileDependency class\n- The Website class was refactored to reflect the changes in the FileDependency class\n- The WebsiteModule class was refactored to override less from GlobalModule base class and the SiteMapUrlRewriter was replaced with SiteMapRouting\n- The WebsiteRobots class was refactored to reflect the changes in the FileDependency class\n\n- The XsltUtility class was refactored to better take advantage of internal caching",
