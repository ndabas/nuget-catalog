  "description": "InjectionMap is a very small and extremely lightweight IoC/DI container for .NET.  \nInjectionMap allows loose coupling betweeen a client's dependencies and its own behaviour. InjectionMap promotes reusability, testability and maintainability of any part of an application.\nInjectionMap supports .Net 4.5, Silverlight 5, Windows Phone 8 or higher and Windows Store apps for Windows 8 or higher.\n\n- InjectionMap uses type mapping to reference the key/reference and the implementation. \n- Instances are resolved using reflection or can be provided through a callback whitch allows you to create the instance in your own code.\n- It suports a fluent syntax to help keep the code simple, small and clean.\n- The desired Constructors can be marked with attributes or will be selected according to the passed arguments.\n- Parameters for constructors can be injected or passed at the time of mapping as objects or as delegate expressions.\n- InjectionMap is very simple and straightforward.\n\nBugs, issues or feature wishes can submitted on https://github.com/InjectionMap/InjectionMap on the issues page or feel free to fork the project and send a pull request.",

  "releaseNotes": "- Changed License to Ms-PL\n- Added InjectionResolver.For<T>() to resolve and extend unmapped types \n- Refactored InjectionResolver.ExtendMap<T>() to simply extend existing mappings\n- Added CLSComplient Attribute to assembly\n- Expression Interfaces don't inherit from IComponentExpression to prevent return values showing component properties. Expression implementaitons additionaly inherit from IComponentExpression.\n- Converted internal Ensure implementation to Extensionmethods\n- Moved Internal implementation from Resolver, Mapping and Component to InjectionMap.Internal namespace",
