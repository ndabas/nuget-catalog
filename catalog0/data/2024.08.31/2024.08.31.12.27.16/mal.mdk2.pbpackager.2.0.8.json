  "releaseNotes": "v.2.0.8\n   - Added symbol map generation to trace mode to help with debugging minification issues.\n   - Fixed more problems with minifier not renaming things it should have and vice versa.\n\nv.2.0.7\n   - Fixed a problem where the minifier replaced a `var` with an incorrect type reference. Now leaving `var` as is.\n   - Now removing `private` and `internal` access modifiers where they are redundant.\n\nv.2.0.6\n   - Fixed a problem where a quirk in Roslyn behavior for indexers would cause a compile error after minification.\n   - Added the missing <mdk sortorder=\"#\"/> feature.\n\nv.2.0.5\n    - Package was not defined as a development dependency\n\nv.2.0.4\n - Reverted a convenience fix that caused more trouble than convenience...\n \nv.2.0.3\n - Fixed a problem where references to generic methods would not be renamed with the full minifier.\n - Fixed a problem where delegates would not be renamed with the full minifier.\n - Intermediate code files are now written to the \\obj folder when trace is enabled.\n \nv.2.0.2\n - Fixed a problem where generic method declarations didn't get their generic parameters renamed with the full minifier.\n - Fixed a problem where the full minifier did not rename catch clause variables\n - Fixed a problem where the full minifier would rename references to protected symbols\n \nv.2.0.1\n - Simplified how project properties are defined and used as their complexity was unnecessary.\n - Restore now checks the other packages for updates as well.\n\nv.2.0.0\n - Official release of MDK2 (Programmable Block Edition)\n\nv.2.0.0-alpha073\n - Minifiers Ahoy! (the two last major minifier components are now in place)\n\nv.2.0.0-alpha072\n - Fixed a bug where references to sub-namespaces would cause compile errors. \n\nv.2.0.0-alpha061\n - Fixed warning about unusable minifier\n\nv.2.0.0-alpha060\n - Wrong / confusing error message for a part of the minifier that isn't finished yet\n  \nv.2.0.0-alpha059\n - Fixed type trimmer removing types it shouldn't have, and vice versa.\n  \nv.2.0.0-alpha058\n - Fixed minifier specification being wrongly named in the package arguments (minifier instead of minify).\n\nv.2.0.0-alpha057\n - Fixed minifier specification being wrongly named in the MDK2 command line (minifier instead of minify).\n\nv.2.0.0-alpha056\n - Added the type trimmer minifier level to the MDK2 command line.\n - Added the comment removal minifier level to the MDK2 command line.\n\nv.2.0.0-alpha054\n - Fixed an issue where the mdk2 .ini file ignores were made with ; as a separator rather than ,.\n\nv.2.0.0-alpha052\n - Added a warning if the final composed script exceeds the maximum allowed character count of the programmable block.\n\nv.2.0.0-alpha051\n - Final structure (I think) for MDK2 command line.\n - Now notifying when new nuget packages are available (currently just Mal.MDK2.PbPackager).\n - Changed to an .ini based configuration rather than an msbuild based one.\n - Added an auto-migrator to add MDK2 support to MDK1 projects.\n\nv.2.0.0-alpha1\n - Emergency publish of a very early build due to the problems with MDK1 and the new version of Visual Studio 2022.\n - This version is highly untested, and is missing the minifier.",
