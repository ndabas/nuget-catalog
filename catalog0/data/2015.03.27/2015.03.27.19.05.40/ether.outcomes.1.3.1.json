  "description": "Outcome.NET lets you return either a result, or a list of messages (usually in the event of failure). It is a fluent, clean, easy-to-learn implementation of the Notification pattern, with a few extras.  \n\nEver write a method that could fail intermittently, like a call to a particularly flaky web service?\n\nTypically, you handle this one of three ways: by throwing/catching exceptions, by tacking boilerplate code onto your result with metadata to indicate success or failure, or by wrapping the result in another object.\n\nAll of these work, but they're plumbing, and that's wasteful. Outcome.NET takes the third approach and extends it, providing an expressive, fluent wrapper that just works.",

  "releaseNotes": "- Switched from .Net 4.5 to .Net 4 for additional compatibility.\n- Added resharper attributes around string format methods.\n- Added deprecation tags to a few methods that are going to be removed in v2.\n- Added FormatMultiLine and marked ToString(string delimiter) as deprecated, since that was an unconventional use of a ToString() override.",
