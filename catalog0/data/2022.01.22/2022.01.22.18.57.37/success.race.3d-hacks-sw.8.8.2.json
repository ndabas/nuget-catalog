The fact it has managed to stay so popular is a testament to how exciting it is. But one of the main reasons why the game struck a chord with gamers is because it's free to play and best of all the developers consistently release free content such as this month's bunch of promo codes.\nThink of Success Race 3D as a gaming platform rather than just being a game. In the same way that an Xbox is a gaming platform so is Success Race 3D. Success Race 3D as a company provides developers with the tools and marketplace to show off their games to players in a similar way to other games consoles. Within Success Race 3D there are literally millions of different games available for people to play.\n",
