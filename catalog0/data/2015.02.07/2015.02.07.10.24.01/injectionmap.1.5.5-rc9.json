  "description": "InjectionMap is a very small and extremely lightweight IoC/DI container for .NET.  \nInjectionMap allows loose coupling betweeen a client's dependencies and its own behaviour. InjectionMap promotes reusability, testability and maintainability of any part of an application.\nInjectionMap supports .Net 4.5, Silverlight 5, Windows Phone 8 or higher and Windows Store apps for Windows 8 or higher.\n\n- InjectionMap uses type mapping to reference the key/reference and the implementation. \n- Instances are resolved using reflection or can be provided through a callback whitch allows you to create the instance in your own code.\n- It suports a fluent syntax to help keep the code simple, small and clean.\n- The desired Constructors can be marked with attributes or will be selected according to the passed arguments.\n- Parameters for constructors can be injected or passed at the time of mapping as objects or as delegate expressions.\n- InjectionMap is very simple and straightforward.\n\nBugs, issues or feature wishes can submitted on https://github.com/InjectionMap/InjectionMap on the issues page or feel free to fork the project and send a pull request.",

  "releaseNotes": "1.5.5\n- Added: PropertyInjection\n- Added: Pass arguments for constructors directly in resolver method\n- Added: Select constructor based on the type of the parameters needed\n- Added: Pass InjectionMap.Argument as arguments instances to resolver\n- Added: Logging/Tracing\n- Refactored: Moved Expression Interfaces to default namespace\n- Refactored: ComponentMapper - Allow access to Context from public\n1.5.4\n- Map to and reslove from a named context\n- Add delegate or instance directly to Map<T>()\n- Moved Initializer methods from InjectionMapper to MapInitializer\n1.5.1\n- Rename MappingContainer to MappingContext\n- Added public accessor to MappingContext in InjectionMap\n1.5.0\n- Allow to pass a MappingContainer to InjectionMapper.Initialize(...)\n- Constructors that have to be used can be defined when creating the map or when resolving.\n1.4.8\n- Renamed IInjectionMapper to IMapInitializer\n- Moved Exceptions to base namespace\n- Moved ComponentMapper to public\n- InjectionMapper.Map<T>() now also maps to custom containers\n- Added ExtendAll<T>() to InjectionResolver to extend all registered mappings of the type\n- Changed License to Ms-PL\n- Added InjectionResolver.For<T>() to resolve and extend unmapped types \n- Refactored InjectionResolver.ExtendMap<T>() to simply extend existing mappings\n- Added CLSComplient Attribute to assembly\n- Expression Interfaces don't inherit from IComponentExpression to prevent return values showing component properties. Expression implementaitons additionaly inherit from IComponentExpression.\n- Converted internal Ensure implementation to Extensionmethods\n- Moved Internal implementation from Resolver, Mapping and Component to InjectionMap.Internal namespace",
