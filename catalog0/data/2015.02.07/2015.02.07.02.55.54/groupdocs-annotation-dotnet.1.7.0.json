  "description": "GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET is a flexible library that allows you to add document & image annotation capability to your web or mobile applications. Based on HTML5 technology, GroupDocs.Annotation library supports more than 45 file formats, allowing end users to annotate documents and images of just about any common business format, including PDF and Microsoft Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, PowerPoint presentations, Visio diagrams, TIFF, JPEG, PNG images and many more. Key benefits include:\n\n1. GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET Library converts documents to HTML5 - a combination of HTML, CSS and SVG.
