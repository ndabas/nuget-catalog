  "description": "DoubleDown Casino Vegas Slots free coins chips cheats promo codes new\n\nCLICK HERE >>>>> https://gamedips.com/doubledown\n\nHere we i will list all the Doubledown codes. Most of the Double Down promotions codes expire for 24- 72 hours except Doubledown Flashgiveaway that expires for 5 hours. All codes posted worked for me when i posted them. Some codes may not work for you becuase you have already collected it from another page or the promo code expired. You can collect codes on your PC/Laptop and mobile device.\n\nIf you follow my Facebook group you already know that i only post working DDC promo codes and people trust me. I do not ask anything in return for the codes i give out to the community.To Collect codes from my page is very easy. Just look below and you will find all the doubledown codes posted for the last 2-3 days including the date when the code was posted. To collect the code you just go the redeemable link.\n\nNote : Sometimes after using the first link other links will give you the message “Expired or already collected” in this case you must clear your browser cache to fix it. Clear your browser cache and continue collecting codes. Collect your Doubledown bonus and have fun playing.\n\nThe DoubleDown Reward Points (DBRP) program is an interesting option and offers unlimited free play.\n\nEvery time you cash in your cash for DBRP, the amount you have in your account is increased by 10%, and more points are awarded for each $1 you spend.\n\nMembers can also transfer points to other members, play Bonus Hands, and Earn Bonus Profits which can be redeemed for cash bonuses or chips at any casino with 50-60 DBRP as bonus players.\n\nThe Casino Players Club is owned by Microgaming and is now one of the top online casinos in the USA. It has plenty of games, including slots, table games, and casino games, and even has its version of a cash bonus system.",
