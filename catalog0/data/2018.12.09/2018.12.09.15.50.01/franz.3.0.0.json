  "releaseNotes": "A lot of bugfixes and new features have been included in this release.\nFixed a bug which would throw an exception when a consumer failed while communicating with a broker. Instead of throwing an exception, we now try to reconnect, and only if this fails throw an exception. The retry interval is defined in the consumer options as ConnectionRetryInterval.\nSupport for specifying which partitions to send messages to. This is done by specifying a key along with the messages, and providing a function used to select the partition based on the key. To use round-robin as previously, you should use the new RoundRobinProducer.\nConsumed messages now also contains the offset and partition for which the message were consumed.\nFixed a bug which would allow you set an offset for a partition, not in the partition whitelist.\nNew consumer, ChunkedConsumer, which consume messages in chunks, and won't use as much memory.\nSupport for version 2 of the OffsetCommit protocol.\nFixed bug where OffsetManager for version 1 of the OffsetCommit protocol did not use the default timestamp value. This resulted in not using the expected offset retention time.\nIncrement correlation id on each request.\nRename Set/GetOffsets methods on the consumer to Set/GetPosition, to clearly indicate these methods has nothing with the offsets handled by the OffsetManager to do.\nSupport user-defined logging by implementing the ILogger interface and set the logger through LogConfiguration.\nMove partition whitelist into ConsumerOptions.\nFix bug in producer where an unavailable broker would result in not refreshing the metadata.\nFix bug where consuming data from a broker going down would result in a infinite loop.\nExperimental support for reading the state and connection to a Kafka cluster through the Zookeeper cluster.\nFSharp.Core is no longer pinned to a specific version",
