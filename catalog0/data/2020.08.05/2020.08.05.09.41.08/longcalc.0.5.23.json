  "releaseNotes": "Unsigned Assembly\n\nCorrected a problem in x.Bernoulli in which an error occured when x was zero.\n\nCorrected a problem in x.Zeta in which an error occured when x was an even integer.\n\nRe-fixed x.Cos, x.Sin, x.Tan to again make sure results are accurate to Precision places, where Precision is measured in decimal digits starting with the left-most non-zero digit.\n\nModified the software to add flexibility and additional functionality, by carrying the changes in the previous two versions a step further. A parameter bf.Threshold of type long has been added that specifies, for bf objects 'x', the maximum value of Log10(x) permitted for the function x.Exp. Thus, all public bf functions (except toString and ToFile) maintain a minimum internal precision for results of at least Threshold decimal digits. Allowed values of Threshold are from 4 to 100000. By permitting Threshold to be small, x.Zeta (which is an admittedly slow function) will finish in an acceptable time for some values of Precision. By permitting Threshold to be large, x.Exp can be calculate for some rather large x. Best Practice: set Threshold only once in every session using LongCalc, and immediately at the start of LongCalc, since it also helps determine the Precision of bf objects derived from string or text data. \n\nChecks for arithmetic overflow or underflow are again compiler-included in this release.",

  "summary": "This library, built with and accessible by Visual Studio (2019) and using Mpir.NET for the underlying integer math and requiring .NetFramework4.5, supplies a variety of math functions and utilities with precisions as large as 2,000,000 base 10 digits when running in x86 mode and much larger in x64 mode. The underlying objects are bf (for 'big float') real values comprised of an mpz_t extended integer part from Mpir.NET and a base 2 exponent, bcr (for complex numbers expressed in the rectangular coordinates) comprised of a bf real part and a bf imaginary part, and bcp (for complex numbers expressed in the polar coordinates) comprised of a bf radius and a bf angle). Functions supported include real and complex versions of: basic arithmetic, trigonometric functions, log and exponential functions, hyperbolic functions and the inverses of all of these, base conversions between bases up to 64, conversions between rectangular and polar coordinates, and some special functions such as Euler, Bernoulli, Gamma, Zeta, and BesselJ. The library also includes a 'bd' (for bigdecimal) object with fractional base 10 digits up to long.MaxValue.",
