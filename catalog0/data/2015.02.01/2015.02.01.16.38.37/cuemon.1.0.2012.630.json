  "description": "If you like the structure of the .NET platform, then the Cuemon .NET Framework Additions might just be that extra solution you have been looking for! With these assemblies I have aimed to accomplish at least two things; simplify the tedious work that is always present when coding towards a generic framework, and implementing some core- and utility classes for you to enjoy.",

  "releaseNotes": "Some bugfixes prior to the last two release, some new features and several improvements through out the Cuemon assembly family.\n\nFurthermore the SqlCeClient related assemblies was correctly adjusted to target .NET Framework 2.0 instead of 4.0, meaning all assemblies are correctly in sync again.\n\nLast but not least; as an experiment, only the AssemblyFileVersion was changed to 1.0.2012.630, leaving the AssemblyVersion unchanged prior to 1.0.2012.390 - this should make an update with strong bindings less painfull.",
