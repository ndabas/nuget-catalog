If you put in the effort then you too can have Generator flowing into your Driving School 3D Simulator account in no time!\nDecentraland is another Metaverse candidate that grapples with this very issue. Dave Carr of the Decentraland Foundation tells me that the founders decided that “rather than have these environments be controlled by central bodies they should have a decentralised structure and be open to everyone to own and govern.” From economic matters to content moderation and even the maintenance of its servers Decentraland’s user base dictates its entire policy course through regular votes.\n",
