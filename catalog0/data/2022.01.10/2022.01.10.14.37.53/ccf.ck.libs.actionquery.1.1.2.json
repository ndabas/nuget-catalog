  "description": "Tiny script language for programmable objects. The language is really minimal, \n    all you can do with it is to write small programs/queries that call methods exposed to the\n    language through a very simple host object. The host makes possible to hide behind it a concept of\n    libraries available anywhere and some explicit methods available only in specific contexts. The \n    language itself consists of syntax for function calls with varying number of arguments, a few special words, \n    resolution of outside read only parameters and only two logical constructs - if and while. It does not\n    need much learning (a couple of minutes should be enough), thus those who use it need only know what can they call from it\n    in the contexts in which they can use it. The purpose of such a script/query is to give the programmer\n    an option to not hard code the logic of certain classes/plugins, but create them as a set of methods that\n    can do the job in various ways if called in different order and supplied with different data. Attaching the\n    ActionQuery to such an object makes possible to program them what to do without rebuilding or even at \n    run-time if the script is reloaded/recompiled. The compilation is a single pass, but the result is \n    independent of any references and can be preserved in a cache for additional performance benefits if the\n    the specific ActionQuery is heavily used. See the documentation for further details (the documentation\n    is in a separate respository together with examples.)",
