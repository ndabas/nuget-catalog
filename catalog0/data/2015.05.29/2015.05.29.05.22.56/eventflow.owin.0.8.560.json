  "releaseNotes": "Breaking: Remove _all_ functionality related to global sequence\nnumbers as it proved problematic to maintain. It also matches this\nquote:\n> Order is only assured per a handler within an aggregate root\n> boundary. There is no assurance of order between handlers or\n> between aggregates. Trying to provide those things leads to\n> the dark side.\n>> Greg Young\n- If you use a MSSQL read store, be sure to delete the\n`LastGlobalSequenceNumber` column during update, or set it to\ndefault `NULL`\n- `IDomainEvent.GlobalSequenceNumber` removed\n- `IEventStore.LoadEventsAsync` and `IEventStore.LoadEvents` taking\na `GlobalSequenceNumberRange` removed\nBreaking: Remove the concept of event caches. If you really need this\nthen implement it by registering a decorator for `IEventStore`\nBreaking: Moved `IDomainEvent.BatchId` to metadata and created\n`MetadataKeys.BatchId` to help access it\nNew: `IEventStore.DeleteAggregateAsync` to delete an entire aggregate\nstream. Please consider carefully if you really want to use it. Storage\nmight be cheaper than the historic knowledge within your events\nNew: `IReadModelPopulator` is new and enables you to both purge and\npopulate read models by going though the entire event store. Currently\nits only basic functionality, but more will be added\nNew: `IEventStore` now has `LoadAllEventsAsync` and `LoadAllEvents` that\nenables you to load all events in the event store a few at a time.\nNew: `IMetadata.TimestampEpoch` contains the Unix timestamp version\nof `IMetadata.Timestamp`. Also, an additional metadata key\n`timestamp_epoch` is added to events containing the same data. Note,\nthe `TimestampEpoch` on `IMetadata` handles cases in which the\n`timestamp_epoch` is not present by using the existing timestamp\nFixed: `AggregateRoot<>` now reads the aggregate version from\ndomain events applied during aggregate load. This resolves an issue\nfor when an `IEventUpgrader` removed events from the event stream\nFixed: `InMemoryReadModelStore<,>` is now thread safe",
