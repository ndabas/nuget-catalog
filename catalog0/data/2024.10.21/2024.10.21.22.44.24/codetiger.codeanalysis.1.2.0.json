  "releaseNotes": "Changes for 1.2.0:\n- Added Roslyn 4.4 as a targeted version\n- Updated CT1707 to properly handle the naming of properties in record declarations\n- Changed CT1712 to allow discards in parenthesized lambda expressions\n- Changed CT2010 to no longer report 'dynamic' in method or property signatures inherited from base types\n- Changed CT3600 and CT3601 to check for inheritdoc comments\n\nChanges for 1.1.5:\n- Fixed the category reported for CT1717 (from CodeTiger.Name to CodeTiger.Naming).\n- Fixed CT1720 false positives for type names that end with something like \"Database\".\n- Changed CT1729 to accept types with a 'Model' suffix within Razor page codebehind files.\n- Removed ending periods from diagnostic titles and messages.\n\nChanges for 1.1.3:\n-Changed CT1701 to allow filenames to end in 'cshtml.cs'.\n\nChanges for 1.1.2:\n-Changed CT1701 to allow filenames to end in 'aspx.cs' and 'xaml.cs'.\n\nChanges for 1.1.1:\n-Relaxed layout rules for attributes applied to parameters.\n\nChanges for 1.1.0:\n-Changed CT1712 to allow discards in lambda expressions.\n-Changed CT1714 to allow property names that are longer words that happen to start with the same characters of the containing type.\n-Changed CT3213 to be case-insensitive.\n-Added CT1011 to identify default parameter values that do not match base definitions.\n-Added CT1012 to identify Attribute subclasses that do not include an AttributeUsage attribute.\n-Added CT1013 to identify public constructors of abstract classes.\n-Added CT1014 to identify externally-accessible members that use tuple types.\n-Added CT1019 to identify when the presence of the 'params' keyword does not match the base definition.\n-Added CT1020 to identify extension methods that do not use the 'this' parameter.\n-Added CT1501 to identify default values of externally-accessible parameters.\n-Added CT1505 to identify composite values of Flags enumerations that are not combinations of other values.\n-Added CT1713 to identify some common hungarian notation.\n-Added CT1802 to identify unnecessary use of the Where LINQ extension method that could be simplified.\n-Added CT3000 to identify files that start with blank lines.\n-Added CT3001 to identify files that do not end with a blank line.\n-Added CT3002 to identify consecutive blank lines.\n\nChanges for 1.0.1:\n-Changed filename analysis to allow underscores for generic type argument separators and suffixes (such as `Tests`) after those separators.\n-Added a resource file for localizable strings.\n-Lots of minor internal code cleanup.\n\nChanges for 1.0.0:\n-Fixed InheritedMemberDesignAnalyzer to better handle System.Object and generic types.\n-Fixed the handling of preprocessor directives by UsingDirectiveOrderAnalyzer.\n-Fixed SingleLineLayoutAnalyzer to not consider attributes when determining the line span of an element.\n-Fixed NonGenericCollectionDesignAnalyzer to better handle field declarations that contain multiple variables.\n-Fixed several possible NullReferenceExceptions in ParenthesisLayoutAnalyzer.\n-Fixed a bug where CommaLayoutAnalyzer used Count instead of SeparatorCount when analyzing AnonymousObjectCreationExpression nodes.\n-Fixed ParenthesisLayoutAnalyzer to not report CT3535 for closing parenthesis after the type in catch clauses that did not include an identifier.\n-Fixed CT1727 and CT1728 to consider generic type parameter constraints when determining whether a method returns a Task.\n-Fixed CT3505 to not include attributes when determining the line span of an accessor.\n-Fixed a false positive of CT3213 with static using directives.\n-Fixed a false positive of CT3503 when a property contains expression-bodied accessors.\n-Excluded attributes applied to accessors when BraceLayoutAnalyzer determines whether an accessor is single- or multi-line.\n-Changed CT3501 to be more permissive with closing braces of multi-line lambdas passed as arguments.\n-Changed ThreadingReliabilityAnalyzer to include the accessibility of the objects containing the member being used when determining overall accessibility.\n-Changed FileNamingAnalyzer to allow file names that follow the standard format for generic types (e.g. 'List`1.cs').\n-Changed BraceLayoutAnalyzer to allow closing curly braces to be followed by where clauses (in a do-while statement), commas, or closing parenthesis.\n-Changed CT3503 to not report expression-bodied properties.\n-Changed CT3503 to not require default values to be on the same line.\n-Changed TypeAliasReadabilityAnalyzer to not check type names in documentation comments.\n-Improved handling of verbatim identifiers.\n-Added '<developmentDependency>true</developmentDependency>' to CodeTiger.CodeAnalysis.nuspec. Removed System.Collections.Immutable.dll from CodeTiger.CodeAnalysis.nuspec.\n-Made several small performance improvements. \n-Added CT1730 to identify type names that match the name of the containing namespace.\n-Added CT3218 to identify non-static using directives that appear after static using directives.\n-Added CT3528 to identify multiple statements on the same line.\n-Added CT3529 to identify LINQ queries that have some (but not all) clauses on the same line.\n-Added CT3532 to identify opening parenthesis that are not on the same line as the preceding keyword.\n-Added CT3533 to identify opening parenthesis that are not on the same line as the preceding identifier.\n-Added CT3534 to identify closing parenthesis that are not on the same line as the preceding argument.\n-Added CT3535 to identify closing parenthesis that are not on the same line as the preceding element.\n-Added CT3536 to identify empty parentheses that are not on the same line.\n-Added CT3537 to identify commas that are not on the same line as their preceding element.\n-Added CT3538 to identify parameter declarations defined across multiple lines.\n-Added CT3539 to identify non-trivial switch section statements that do not begin on a new line.\n-Added CT3540 to identify binary operators at the end of a line.",
