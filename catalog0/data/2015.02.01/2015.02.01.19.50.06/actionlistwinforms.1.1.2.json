  "description": "Everyone who has worked with Borland's Delphi knows how powerful Actions are. Actions are used to link together various UI elements, such as buttons, menu items, and toolbar buttons, making them behave consistently: linked items are checked/ unchecked/ enabled/ disabled at the same time, and they share the same Text and eventually Image property and, of course, execute the same code once clicked.\n\nActionList for .NET brings these features to Windows Forms developers.",
