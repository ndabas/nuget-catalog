The value of the card is loaded at the time of purchase and your spending is limited to the amount of money placed on the card by the purchaser.\n\nBefore using the card, record your card number and keep it in a safe place in the eventyour card would become lost or stolen. Sign the card on the back signature panel. It is also a good idea to register the card, especially for online or mail order purchases, at. \nTo make a purchase, make sure you know the amount remaining on the card then select credit and sign for the purchase. The debit option requires a PIN to work. The card does not come with a preset PIN, so you will need to set one prior to making the purchase for the debit option to work.\nMost merchants will permit you to use your card for part of the purchase price and pay the remainder by cash, check, or other card. Let the merchant know in advance that you will be using two methods of payment. Let them know exactly what amount is to be applied to the gift card, then pay the remaining amount with your second form of payment. (th)",
