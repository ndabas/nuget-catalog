  "releaseNotes": "Version 5.0.7 - January 27, 2016\n- Fixed: A security vulnerability with resource.ashx when application pool account was misconfigured.\n- Fixed: When no root folders were defined, the control was not being rendered due to a JS error (blank page).\n\nVersion 5.0.6 - January 24, 2016\n- Improved: Updated media player for better Firefox compatibility.\n\nVersion 5.0.5 - January 17, 2016\n- Fixed: Updated GleamTech.Core for fixing some routing issues.\n- Fixed: Image Viewer file types were not being considered as preview types so \"Preview\" command was not being\n  shown/enabled in context menu and toolbar. However double-clicking on the file was still opening the Image Viewer.\n- Fixed: Text of buttons on toolbar had underlines when hovered in some pages if there was a:hover definition in page's CSS.\n- Fixed: .mhtml file extension icon was not shown like .mht.\n\nVersion 5.0.4 - January 11, 2016\n- Fixed: Intermittent \"Could not load document\" error in Document Viewer although the document was loaded and displayed.\n- Fixed: Media Player was not starting to play a video if it was in an archive (eg. zip file)\n- Fixed: For video thumbnails, the duration overlay text was not aligned exactly at center of the rectangle.\n\nVersion 5.0.3 - January 10, 2016\n- Fixed: Updated GleamTech.Core for fixing some possible Json serialization problems.\n- Fixed: Image Viewer did not refresh an image if it was edited externally, last modified time was not\n  taken into account so the old version from the browser cache was displayed.\n\nVersion 5.0.2 - January 7, 2016\n- Changed: Slight licensing change to support new license types.\n\nVersion 5.0.1 - January 6, 2016\n- Fixed: \"Could not load file or assembly Microsoft.Web.Infrastructure\" error on some machines.\n\nVersion 5.0 - January 5, 2016\n- Added: New Windows 10 UI theme.\n- Added: New flat/modern file type icons.\n- Added: New advanced Document Viewer with High Resolution. Text, fonts and vector elements are preserved and \n  rendered in high-res with no rasterization. Zoom in as much as you want, your document will look great.\n  Also performance in regards to the old viewer will be much better.\n- Added: Advanced Image Viewer with zooming and panning feature. The viewer can display several image formats including \n  Photoshop files.\n- Improved: New faster image thumbnail generation with caching support.\n- Changed: Some API. Renamed ControlContext to FileUltimateConfiguration, use FileUltimateConfiguration.Current to \n  change global configuration. Removed FileManager.LicenseKey property, use FileUltimateConfiguration.Current.LicenseKey \n  instead. Routes can be re-added via FileUltimateConfiguration.RestoreRoutes.\n- Changed: Separated GleamTech.FileUltimate.dll into multiple assemblies as some features are now also separate products.\n  You only need to reference GleamTech.Core.dll and GleamTech.FileUltimate.dll in your project, the other DLLs \n  in the same folder GleamTech.ImageUltimate.dll, GleamTech.VideoUltimate.dll and GleamTech.DocumentUltimate.dll are\n  assemblies for the new products with the same name and also FileUltimate depends on them for some of the features.\n  Msbuild or Visual Studio will automatically copy these 3 DLLs along with the main file GleamTech.FileUltimate.dll \n  to your bin folder during build so they don't need to be referenced directly. Note that even without these 3 DLLs,\n  FileUltimate will work but it will just turn off the corresponding features such as generating image or video \n  thumbnails or the document viewer. So with this new modular approach, you can opt-out of the features you do not\n  need by excluding one of the DLLs.\n- Improved: Many minor fixes and performance improvements.",
