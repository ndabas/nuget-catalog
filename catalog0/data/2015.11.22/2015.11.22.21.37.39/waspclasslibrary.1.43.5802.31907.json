  "releaseNotes": "History\n      11/20/2015\n      1. The OEMCryptoClass has a static method AddKeys that allow OEMs to add their cryptographic keys. This is a breaking change for OEM branded WASPs when the key is not added to the OEMCryptoClass.\n      2. The USBConnector class now supports WASP-N base station mode.\n      3. Removed ChannelResponseTimeout method from AntDevice class. It is no longer needed.\n      4. Fixed issues with queue/channel management in the AntRadio class. Added overload StartOrQueueChannel(AntDevice ant) to automatically handle channel assignment.\n      5. The Wasp class now provides support for base station mode.\n      6. A new property CollectionVerbosity has been added to the WaspCollection to control trace messages.\n      \n      A help file to guide the developer has been added to the package. It is installed in the Help folder.\n\nThe native DLLs SLAB*.dll are now part of the build target and are no longer added to your project source files. Build your project for x86. AnyCPU and x64 are currently unsupported; we do intend to add support in the next release.\n\n      11/6/2015\n      Note that this is a beta release.\n\n      1. Changed target framework from .NET Framework 4.5.2 to .NET 4.5.\n      2. Class AntRadioEventArgs - the second constructor takes a message that begins with the length.\n      3. Improved error handling, particularly for burst transfers.\n      4. Upgraded USB support for both WASP-B and WASP-N.\n\n      9/28/2015\n      Fixed bug in bike speed, cadance, and combined sensors where it periodically reported 0 for instantaneous values and event times.\n\n      9/24/2015\n      1. Changed target framework from .NET Framework 4 Client Profile to .NET Framework 4.5.2. You may need to retarget your application.\n      2. Added timeout timers for each channel.\n      3. If a channel response is not received before the timeout timer has expired, the channel is reset by sending the AssignChannel/UnassignChannel commands.\n      4. Attempt to reconnect to wasp if socket disconnects.\n\n      Known Issues:\n      Still working on programming WASP-POE.",
