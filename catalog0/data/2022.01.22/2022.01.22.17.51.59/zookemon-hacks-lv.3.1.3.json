  "description": "\nZookemon MOD APK Free Coins Generator\n==========================================================================================================================================================================================\n\n4 minutes ago -Howdy, Zookemon MOD APK Free Coins Generator. . - Zookemon MOD APK Free Coins Generator GENERATOR Zookemon MOD APK Free Coins Generator NO HUMAN VERIFICATION Zookemon MOD APK Free Coins Generator 600 Their goal is to take your account name\n\nCLICK HERE >>> https://gamecoins.codes/tools/9219045.html\n\nCLICK HERE >>> https://gamecoins.codes/tools/9219045.html\n\nDon’t forget that there’s also the avatar shop which comes with free stuff as well. All you need to do is to search the avatar shop for the word “free”. Then look for featured items. You have plenty of stuff to get from new avatars to emotes and accessories. If you want to redeem them sign in to your account then click on the item you want then click the “Get” button which will bring up a prompt. Then click on “Get Now” in order to add that item to your account.\nOr you can have your digital reward earnings transferred directly into your PayPal account. Once this is done you can proceed to purchase Generator directly from the game store at no extra cost.\nAfter this head to the \"Create\" tab at the top of the Zookemon site and select Shirts or Pants. From here click the gear icon to the left of the clothing click Configure and then Sales. This brings up a screen that prompts the player to put in a Generator price for their item.\nThere are however a few easy things you can do to minimise the risk. First off as mentioned above don’t tell your kid the password to their Zookemon account. The reason behind this is the ‘Zookemon’ scams that proliferate the internet. These sites get your details by disguising themselves as sites that look like an official Zookemon page and encourage people to log into their Zookemon account via their page to claim ‘Zookemon’. If you do this you have just given the scammers all of the information they need to take over the account and clear it out. No matter how tempting these sites are you need to know that there is NO SUCH THING AS Zookemon. Only purchase Generator using the methods mentioned before.\n\"Report messages links and games right away by using the Report Abuse links and buttons located around the apps and in every game menu. Our moderators will be able to take correct action against people trying to scam your account. You will also be helping to make Zookemon an even better place! You can adjust your Settings to prevent others from sending these sorts of messages by selecting Privacy and choose who is allowed to send you messages chats and more.\"\nZookemon LINKS\n",
