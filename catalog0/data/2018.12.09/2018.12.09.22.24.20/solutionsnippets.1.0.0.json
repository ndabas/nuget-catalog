  "description": "Snippets on the fly! Manage C# code snippets on solution level\n\n      _about this package_\n\n      This package will enable you to manage and maintain solution agnostic C# code snippets. In other words, snippets in a solution will be deployed automatically upon build - so you can manage snippets on a \"per solution\" basis.\n      Just drop the *.snippet files that should be availabe to developers of your solution anywhere under the solution folder.\n      SolutionSnippets will discover all those files and deploy them into a special folder \"__Blue.Utils.SolutionSnippets\" to the current user´s snippet folder.\n      (this would be \"{Documents}\\Visual Studio 2012\\Code Snippets\\Visual C#\\My Code Snippets\\__Blue.Utils.SolutionSnippets\", where {Documents} is the local user´s documents library.\n      This way, SolutionSnippets won´t interfere with already existing snippets.\n\n      It is totally sufficient when there is exactly one project within your solution that installs SolutionSnippets, as all snippets-files under your solution folder will be deployed.\n\n      All you need to do to deploy your solution agnostic snippets is to start a build.\n      When building your solution, all existing solution agnostic snippets are removed.\n      After that, all snippets in the scope of the current solution are deployed to your user´s snippet folder\n      (remember: SolutionSnippets does not touch any existing snippets)\n\n      _under the hood_\n      \n      There is (sadly) no black magic involved in deploying solution agnostic snippets. The main work is done by common msbuild-tasks. Only resolving the local user´s snippet folder is done by a custom build-task.\n      \n      _known caveats_\n\n      Under certain circumstances Visual Studio does not reflect changes to snippets immediatly. In those cases, just restart the Visual Studio instance.\n      In the meantime, go vote for this feature: http://visualstudio.uservoice.com/forums/121579-visual-studio/suggestions/4152530-add-the-ability-to-refresh-individual-or-all-snipp\n\n      Send feedback, feature-request, unexpected breaking changes, bugs, etc. via the projects nuget-page, http://www.nuget.org/packages/SolutionSnippets/ContactOwners, until there is a projet homepage...",
