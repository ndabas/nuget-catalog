  "description": "Fast Artificial Neural Network (FANN) Library is a free open source neural network library, which implements multilayer artificial neural networks in C with support for both fully connected and sparsely connected networks.\n\nCross-platform execution in both fixed and floating point are supported. It includes a framework for easy handling of training data sets. It is easy to use, versatile, well documented, and fast.\n\nFann C# is a wapper around FANN that lets you use the FANN libraries from C# on Windows. Currently all methods of the neural_net and training_data classes have been implemented. Additionally the new FANN parallel methods have been added as part of the NeuralNet classes.",
