  "description": "C# Property Mapper that utilizes attributes in order to perform the mapping.\n\nWhile I personally love auto mappers, I don't like being forced to configure \none type to another. In the end, I am just mapping one set of properties to\nanother set of properties. All I care about is that the names match\n(or I can tell it what name to look for) and the types are assignable.\nClassyMapper will do just that!",

  "releaseNotes": "- Fixed a bug where using the mapper with the same object would result in the previously cached version being returned\n- Added support for mapping nullable enums\n- Added support to use Expression Tree get/set for mapping instead of reflection; The higher the number of objects/properties being mapped, the faster Expression Tree becomes but has a higher up front price so it is turned off by default\n- Refactored some of the code to make the AssignValue method easier to read\n- Made the constructor public since there was no reason not to (can do new ClassyMapper() if you want)\n- Added IClassyMapper interface in case you want to IoC inject it\n- Added new RegisterConstructor method to allow you to map classes that have no parameterless constructor",
