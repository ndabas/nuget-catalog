  "releaseNotes": "Release Notes for Couchbase Client Library .NET 1.3.6 GA (5 June 2014)\n\nNCBC-503: CouchbaseCluster construction is missing un/pw\n\nThis patch fixes a bug where the username and password was not being included in the REST call to the API. This would cause the API to return a 401 Unauthorized evan if the password and username were included within object creation.\n\nNCBC-457: Change verbosity of HB logging to DEBUG\n\nThis patch changes the verbosity of the logging within the heartbeat component from INFO to DEBUG. \n\nNCBC-485: Small TTL values can get lost by client/server clock-drift\n\nThis patch fixes a bug where differences between the server clock and the client clock would cause small timespans to provide inconsistent and unexpected results. \n\nNCBC-499: Refactor InternalPoolImpl so that NRE is not thrown\n\nThis patch provides a more defensive Dispose method implmentation so that when multiple threads try to dispose on the pool, only one thread will perform the dispose. It also protects against NullReferenceExceptions by checking for nullity of internal references before calling their dispose methods.\n\nNCBC-494: Finalizer throws NRE if Pools has already been finalized/GC'd\n\nFixes a race condition where the internal CouchbasePool may have already been GC'd before the finalizer is run on the parent object, causing a NullReferenceException (NRE) to be thrown.\n\n",
