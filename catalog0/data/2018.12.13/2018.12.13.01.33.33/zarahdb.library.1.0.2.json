  "description": "The Operating System is the database, because every record is stored as a single file stored by the filesystem, accessed by a unique key, which is used to define where on disk the file resides. What this does is make it so whatever key you have, you can access the related data by directly accessing a single file. This is a very granular, performant manner to deal with data, and the limits to size, accessability and availability are controlled by the infrastructure and not limited by ZarahDB. If the OS can reach the file, ZarahDB can work with it. This means you can have as many nodes as can share a file, as many records as disk can hold, as much sharding of data as folder structures allow. From a scaling perspective, it is very robust.",
