  "releaseNotes": "Unsigned Assembly\n\nFixed a problem in the previous version with x.ToFile in which no more than 100,000,000 digits were written to the file, regardless of the precision requested.\n\nAlso, an additional, optional parameter was added to x.toString and x.ToFile for a bf object 'x' and to bf object creation from a string or file to allow the exponent part of the scientific-notation string or file text to be encoded in the same base as that of the mantissa part. Previously the exponent had always been in base 10 digits regardless of the base used to represent the mantissa.\n\nA number of bugs in the new bd object routines were found and fixed. Also, several new functions were added and some existing ones enhanced. bd objects can now be exported to/imported from files much like bf objects. Log2(x) and Log10(x) static functions were added. x.Square and x.Truncate were added. In the x.toString and x.ToFile functions, an optional 'Prettify' parameter was added. (Many people might wonder why anyone would deliberately insert a lot of whitespace into numeric text. In the past, however, I have found that doing so causes loading such text into VisualStudio text boxes to happen more quickly.)  \n\nThis version also enhances the XML documentation and that documentation might now provide some useful information.\n\nChecks for arithmetic overflow or underflow are again compiler-included in this release.",

  "summary": "This library, built with and accessible by Visual Studio (2019) and using Mpir.NET for the underlying integer math and requiring .NetFramework4.5, supplies a variety of math functions and utilities with precisions as large as 2,000,000 base 10 digits when running in x86 mode and much larger in x64 mode. The underlying objects are bf (for 'big float') real values comprised of an mpz_t extended integer part from Mpir.NET and a base 2 exponent, bcr (for complex numbers expressed in the rectangular coordinates) comprised of a bf real part and a bf imaginary part, and bcp (for complex numbers expressed in the polar coordinates) comprised of a bf radius and a bf angle). Functions supported include real and complex versions of: basic arithmetic, trigonometric functions, log and exponential functions, hyperbolic functions and the inverses of all of these, base conversions between bases up to 64, conversions between rectangular and polar coordinates, and some special functions such as Euler, Bernoulli, Gamma, Zeta, and BesselJ. The library also includes a 'bd' (for bigdecimal) object with fractional base 10 digits up to long.MaxValue.",
