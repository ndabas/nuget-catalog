  "description": "It just gets to all the pixels in the image and store their color value as a key in a hash map. The value is then the number of pixels of the same color encountered. However, this gives poor results so here are the improvements I wrote:\nI treat at most 5000 pixels so if the image is bigger I start undersampling. This is an order of magnitude, not a certain rule.\nTo avoid noise due to flat areas (text, borders, ...) I start by right shifting all the RGB values by 6. So all the values are now between 0 and 3, allowing to encompass large areas of almost-the-same color. Then I perform another pass of the same algorithm (with a shift of 4) on all the pixels falling in the previous winning color group. And so on until I reach zero.\nWhen trying to find the group that has the most pixels, I use a callback to weight the score. This allows customization and tell the algorithm you wand a rather dark color, you wan to exclude black, you want only highly saturated color excluding the greys or anything else you might think of.",
