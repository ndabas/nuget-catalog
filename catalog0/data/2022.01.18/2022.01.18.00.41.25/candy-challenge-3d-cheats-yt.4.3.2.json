So taking advantage of the free codes is an excellent method to add some variety to the in-game wardrobe. But remember that promo codes may expire or only be active for a short period of time so make sure to use the codes right away.\nPromo codes– Promotional codes appear from time to time to get free in-game items but it’s never about Generator. However thanks to these promocodes we can get objects and skins for which we would normally pay Generator.\n\"Once all info is submitted and the magic “Do things now” button is pressed it delivers the well-worn trick of popping a fake box claiming things are happening behind the scenes. Secret hacker-style things working their magic on Candy Challenge 3D servers ... All you’ll get for your troubles is your personal information added to marketing databases via the survey links.\"\nBefore creating any custom design to sell the player will need to make sure they have already created an item of clothing. It's possible to upload a skin of the clothing directly to Candy Challenge 3D thereby showing the design on your character and making it available for use.\n",
