  "description": "Supported Platforms:\n• NETFramework\n\n\nHigh-end DICOM and medical image viewing components with fully customizable cell and sub-cell layout, window leveling, text overlay, annotations, CINE playback, 3D reconscrution and visualization, and specialized medical image processing.\n\nThis package contains LEADTOOLS user interface controls for applications targeting the .NET Windows Forms platform.\n\n\n** Medical Viewing and Annotation **\n\nThe LEADTOOLS Medical Viewer Control is a high-level component for developers to build medical display solutions such as view stations, teleradiology applications, and high-end diagnostic workstations found in radiology and other medical specialty departments.  Whether you are building a PACS viewer for radiology, cardiology, mammography, ophthalmology, pathology, dermatology, dentistry, or any other specialty, the DICOM Viewer Control eliminates complexity from your projects and sets a solid DICOM and imaging foundation on which you can rely.  For an HTML5/JavaScript Zero-footprint version of the Medical Viewer, go to https://www.leadtools.com/sdk/medical/html5\n\nLEADTOOLS DICOM Annotations provides two different means for reading and writing legacy LEADTOOLS annotations in a DICOM data set.\n\n   1. In Part 3 of the DICOM Specification, the description for the “Graphic Annotation Module” describes how Annotations are to be stored in a DICOM Presentation State. The “Graphic Annotation Module” includes Text Objects, Graphic Objects, and Compound Graphics. LEADTOOLS has full support for converting between the LEADTOOLS Annotations and the DICOM Graphic Annotation Module in a DICOM Presentation State (i.e., DICOM Annotations).\n\n   2. Alternatively, there is support for reading and writing legacy LEADTOOLS Annotations in the LEAD Native format as a private element in a DICOM data set.\n\n\n** 3D Reconstruction and Visualization **\n\nLEADTOOLS provides world-class Medical 3D technology that reconstructs three-dimensional visual representations from two-dimensional image slices, such as MRI and CT stacks. LEADTOOLS Medical 3D Technology offers many different data representations using various 3D reconstruction techniques such as MPR, VRT, MIP, MinIP, and SSD, and projection techniques that support clipping planes, slab, scale, zoom, camera control, threshold, transparency, and image processing.\n\n\n** DICOM Data Set **\n\nLEADTOOLS provides complete support for DICOM data sets described in the latest DICOM specification and supplements, including all IOD classes and modalities such as CR, CT, MR, NM, US, RF, SC, and VL.\n\n\n** Image Processing **\n\nLEADTOOLS includes libraries that offer an advanced set of functions specially designed to enhance and analyze medical images regardless of the format or data distribution. You can enhance the image or highlight the details by shifting, selecting, subtracting, and removing the background. This flexibility allows doctors and specialists to diagnose diseases and injuries faster and more accurately. \n\nThis is just a small part of a large technology offering called LEADTOOLS.
