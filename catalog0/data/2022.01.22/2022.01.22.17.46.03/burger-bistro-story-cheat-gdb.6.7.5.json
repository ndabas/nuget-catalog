In a popular third-person horror game called Piggy I had to flee from a terrifying pig wielding a baseball bat. One of the top Burger Bistro Story genres is “obbys” short for “obstacle courses” where you have to navigate precarious platforms and avoid well obstacles. I even found a clone of Counter-Strike called Counter Blox.\nIn 2016 it was discontinued because the developers thought that it was leading to a lot of confusion in the community.\n",
