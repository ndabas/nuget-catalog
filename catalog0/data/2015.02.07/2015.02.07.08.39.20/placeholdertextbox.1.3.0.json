  "description": "In many cases, a TextBox with an easy Placeholder property would be very helpful especially when you want the user to filter a ListView or ListBox by search terms.\n\nSo, I never found a really good one. I know there exists a very easy method with only one SendMessage method, but I don't like it because the placeholder is hard to differentiate with the actually typed text and I don't like these message things very much, too many things can go wrong.\n\nNow I created my own control and my destination is that it is very easy to use.",
