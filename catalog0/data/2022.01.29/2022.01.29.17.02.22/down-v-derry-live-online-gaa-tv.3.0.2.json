  "description": "Derry return to Division Two for the first time since 2017 and host Down in Owenbeg in Saturday evening's round one tie.\n\nLink here==> https://tinyurl.com/mppnc2pm\n\nRory Gallagher's men gained promotion as Division Three winners following their facile 0-21 to 1-6 win over Offaly in Croke Park last June in what was the only football league final to take place last season.\n\nDown, on the other hand, had to defeat Laois in a relegation play-off to retain their Division Two status with Paddy Tally stepping down in the wake of their subsequent Ulster Championship loss to Donegal.\n\nJames McCartain assumed the reins for a second term in November and the Mournemen suffered defeats to both Donegal and Antrim in the pre-season Dr McKenna Cup with Derry losing out to Donegal in the semi-final.\n\nIt is the first game of the new league campaign and both sides will want to get off to a good start.\n\nThe GAAâ€™s Central Competitions Controls Committee (CCCC) is expected to recommend the end of the use of water breaks ahead of the start of the Allianz Football League this weekend.",
