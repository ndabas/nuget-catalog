Instead of raw bytes VbaProject property representation of VBA project, the new IVbaProject interface implementation added.\nUse new IVbaProject to manage VBA Project embedded in the presentation. You can add new project references, edit existing modules and create new ones.\nAlso, you can create a new VBA Project using VbaProject class which implements IVbaProject interface.\nFollowing example shows creation of the simple VBA project containing one module and adding two required references to the libraries.\n\nusing (Presentation pres = new Presentation())\n{\n    // Create new VBA Project\n    pres.VbaProject = new VbaProject();\n\n    // Add empty module to the VBA project\n    IVbaModule module = pres.VbaProject.Modules.AddEmptyModule(\"Module\");\n\n    // Set module source code\n    module.SourceCode =\n        @\"Sub Test(oShape As Shape)\n            MsgBox \"\"Test\"\"\n        End Sub\";\n\n    // Create reference to stdole\n    VbaReferenceOleTypeLib stdoleReference =\n        new VbaReferenceOleTypeLib(\"stdole\", \"*\\\\G{00020430-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}#2.0#0#C:\\\\Windows\\\\system32\\\\stdole2.tlb#OLE Automation\");\n\n    // Create reference to Office\n    VbaReferenceOleTypeLib officeReference =\n        new VbaReferenceOleTypeLib(\"Office\", \"*\\\\G{2DF8D04C-5BFA-101B-BDE5-00AA0044DE52}#2.0#0#C:\\\\Program Files\\\\Common Files\\\\Microsoft Shared\\\\OFFICE14\\\\MSO.DLL#Microsoft Office 14.0 Object Library\");\n\n    // Add references to the VBA project\n    pres.VbaProject.References.Add(stdoleReference);\n    pres.VbaProject.References.Add(officeReference);\n\n    pres.Save(\"test.pptm\", SaveFormat.Pptm);\n}\n\nThis example shows how you can copy VBA project from existing presentation to a newly created\n\nusing (Presentation pres1 = new Presentation(\"PresentationWithMacroses.pptm\"), pres2 = new Presentation())\n{\n    pres2.VbaProject = new VbaProject(pres1.VbaProject.ToBinary());\n}\n\nProperty Aspose.Slides.Charts.IChartSeries.Overlap has been added\n\nProperty Aspose.Slides.Charts.IChartSeries.Overlap specifies how much bars and columns shall overlap on 2-D charts (from -100 to 100).\nThis is the property not only of this series but of all series of parent series group - this is projection of appropriate group property. And so this property is read-only.\nUse ParentSeriesGroup property for access to parent series group.  \nUse ParentSeriesGroup.Overlap read/write property for change value.\n\nusing (Presentation pres = new Presentation())\n{\n   IChart chart = pres.Slides[0].Shapes.AddChart(ChartType.ClusteredColumn, 50, 50, 600, 400, true);\n   IChartSeriesCollection series = chart.ChartData.Series;\n   if (series[0].Overlap == 0)\n      {\n            series[0].ParentSeriesGroup.Overlap = -30;\n      }\n}\n\nProperty Aspose.Slides.Charts.IChartSeriesGroup.Overlap has been added\n\nProperty Aspose.Slides.Charts.IChartSeriesGroup.Overlap property specifies how much bars and columns shall overlap on 2-D charts (from -100 to 100).\n\nusing (Presentation pres = new Presentation())\n{\n   IChart chart = pres.Slides[0].Shapes.AddChart(ChartType.ClusteredColumn, 50, 50, 600, 400, true);\n   IChartSeriesCollection series = chart.ChartData.Series;\n   series[0].ParentSeriesGroup.Overlap = -30;\n}\n\nShapeThumbnailBounds.Appearance enum value has been added\n\nThis method of shape thumbnail creation allows to generate a shape thumbnail in the bounds of its appearance. It takes into account all shape effects. The generated shape thumbnail is restricted by slide bounds.\n\nusing (Presentation p = new Presentation(\"Presentation.pptx\"))\n{\n    Bitmap st = p.Slides[0].Shapes[0].GetThumbnail(ShapeThumbnailBounds.Appearance, 1, 1);\n    st.Save(\"ShapeThumbnail.png\", ImageFormat.Png);\n}",
