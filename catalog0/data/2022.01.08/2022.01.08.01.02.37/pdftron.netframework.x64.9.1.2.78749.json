  "releaseNotes": "New Features\nAdvanced Imaging Module, supporting the DICOM image format and many others.\nFlexible and powerful document generation using office templates. Full reflow, and retains all document styles.\nAdded PDF2Word Module that enables conversion to Word. (Convert.ToWord()).\nAdded PDF2HtmlReflowParagraphsModule Module and HTMLOutputOptions.SetContentReflow() that can be used to utilize it when calling Convert.ToHtml.\nAdded a PDFTron Custom Security Handler that can be used to produce PDF files that can only be decrypted by PDFTron SDK and only if the password is correct and the specified id has been registered by the application. (PDFTronCustomSecurityHandler class and PDFNet.AddPDFTronCustomHandler) This provides a level of security very similar to that of writing a custom encryption method, but is much simpler to use.\nAdded an API to manually add or edit marked content. (ElementBuilder.CreateMarkedContentBegin, ElementBuilder.CreateMarkedContentEnd, ElementBuilder.CreateMarkedContentPoint etc.)\nAdded an API to produce pages showing the text differences between two pages or documents. (PDFDoc.AppendTextDiff) This API is currently experimental and subject to change.\nAdded a new API to trust certificates in the FDF Data/Cert Exchange format. (VerificationOptions.LoadTrustList) This provides overall more correct results during verification than VerificationOptions.AddTrustedCertificates as it can handle more fine-grained trust settings.\nAdded new optional trust flags as input to VerificationOptions::AddTrustedCertificate to configure the desired level of trust.\nAdded support for specifying locale for Office conversions.\nAdded a filetype option to 'Convert' methods that accept a Filter and not a file path.\nOther Changes\nOther Improvements\n[pdf] Updated Duktape to 2.6.0.\n[jpg] Updated libjpeg-turbo to 2.0.6.\n[tiff] Updated libTIFF to 4.2.0.\n[pdf] Updated OpenSSL to 1.1.1j.\n[all] Added macOS arm64 slice for Apple Silicon.\n[all] Enabled better optimization settings on PDFTron SDK on Windows.\n[xfdf] Significantly optimized the performance of XFDF export.\n[pdf] Optimized creation of PDFDoc, SDFDoc, FDFDoc and ObjSet objects. This has a significant impact on cases that create a large number of these objects.\n[xfdf] Improved support for importing XFDF into PDFs with corrupt Annotations array.\n[xfdf] Generating consistent names on all unnamed annotations for during xfdfexport. This is especially helpful for realtime collaboration use-cases.\n[xfdf] Adjusted rectangle, ellipse, export and import to support nonstandard rotation in import and export.\n[pdf] Adjusted logic for retaining text spacing adjustments, so that it would work with interleaved marked content operators.\n[pdf] Avoid \"faded colors\" during PDF rendering when color management is disabled and overprint is off.\n[pdf] Avoid writing unnecessary colors and colorspaces when generating annotation appearance streams.\n[pdf] Adjustment to repair corrupt documents with negative or unreasonably large object numbers.\n[pdf] Erase invalid colorspace entries in ImageMasks during PDF/A conversion\n[svg] Better handle corrupt documents with unbalanced q/Q operators in forms during Convert.ToSvg.\n[pdf] Added support for trusting intermediate certificates in the chain during for Digital Signature Verification.\n[pdf] Adjusted corrupt document processing logic to allow for an XRef entry following startxref. Previously this would be treated as garbage data and the rest of the PDF would be skipped.\n[pdf] Improved reading for field values from XFA to better handle strangely formed inheritance structures.\n[xod] Adjusted flattening to disregard cases where the blend mode is specifically set to normal. This reduces unnecessary flattening for ToXod and Flattener improving run time and output quality in these cases.\n[pdf] Optimized PDF/A conversion for files with a lot of font objects.\n[pdf] Optimized text extraction to more efficiently extract styles. This primarily impacts text selection, reflow and use cases that use TextExtractor directly to obtain text styles.\n[pdf] Added support for dashed borders on checkboxes.\n[pdf] Added support for auto-tiling of very large tiff images\n[pdf] A number of new APIs were exposed in the pdfnet-node package.\n[pdf] Handle Exif rotations through the UniversalConversion methods on the Convert class\nBugfixes\n[pdf] Fixed a parsing issue where unusually structured encrypted documents could fail to load.\n[pdf] Avoiding a crash when using incremental download on rare documents that start with a null object.\n[xfdf] Fixed an issue with PDFDoc.FDFUpdate where it could remove RichMedia and other less commonly used annotation types.\n[pdf] Fixed incorrect text extraction word break issue when text includes a vowel sign.\n[xfdf] Fixed an issue in PDFDoc.FDFUpdate where, in rare situations, radio buttons could be incorrectly matched and not function as expected.\n[pdf] Fixed a problem where certain PDF JPEG2000 images with 4 bits per component would display as darker than they should.\n[pdf] Fixed an issue where some documents with XFA values wouldn't take these into account when displaying the selected state of check boxes and radio buttons.\n[pdf] Fixed a problem where the Metadata would still be encrypted even if using SetEncryptedMetadata(false)\n[pdf] Fixed a problem with PDFDocInfo.GetSDFObj() where it would return the trailer rather than the Info object as would be expected.\n[pdf] Fixed an issue with Optimizer where, on certain documents and when subsetting fonts, it could break the appearance of hidden annotations. This could lead to issues later when the annotation becomes no longer hidden.\n[pdf] Adjusted page insertion to clear any DigitalSignatures when inserting into a new document. Previously these would be included, but invalid.\n[pdf] Adjusted handling of Field Flags to ignore them when they are incorrectly applied to Widget only dictionaries.\n[pdf] Adjusted PDF/A validation to not provide an error for Device colorspaces (e.g. DeviceRGB) if there is an associated Default colorspace in the resource dictionary. (e.g. DefaultRGB)\n[pdf] Fixed an issue with the generated appearance of line annotations with inline captions where the line would go through the text.\n[pdf] Fixed an issue with handling of 0 length streams that could lead to slow and unexpected file growth. This issue was especially troublesome when saving large files.\n[pdf] Fix for incorrect color in some DCTDecode images where the embedded colorspace conflicts with the PDF colorspace\n[pdf] Closed potential security issue with FileAttachment annotations, where a specifically constructed annotation could access external servers during XFDF export\n[pdf] Generated fully selectable text when generating complicated shaped text output\n[pdf] Fix for potential non-optimal performance when filling an internal object cache\n[tiff] Fix for potential crash when reading some YCbCr encoded images.\n[pdf] Fixed an issue with creating bad width tables in fonts covering codepoints outside the basic multilingual plane\n[pdf] fixed an issue with bad lookups in a font's toUnicode map when handling codepoints outside the basic multilingual plane\n[emf] Now correctly handle PDFs embedded within EMF files\n[all] Fix for mishandling of short font names in all caps, like \"OCR-B\"\n[all]
