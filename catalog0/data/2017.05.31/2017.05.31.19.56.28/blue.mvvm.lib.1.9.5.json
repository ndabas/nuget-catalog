  "description": "MVVM, bare knuckle style!\n      Blue.MVVM is, and will remain, an ultra lightweight suite supporting your Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) based applications.\n\n\n      _about this package_\n\n      This package includes binaries only. You should use this package for test projects or assemblies that need to interact with types in Blue.MVVM.\n      For a head start, use Blue.MVVM (http://www.nuget.org/packages/Blue.MVVM/) instead.\n\n\n      _what to expect in future releases?_\n\n      There are many ideas around regarding upcoming releases of the Blue.MVVM suite.\n      However, those updates will be shipped in form of additional packages. This way, you can add just those packages that best fits your application and needs.\n\n      Upcoming releases may include, but are not limited to:\n      + XML-comments\n      - packages with samples\n      - (fluid)validation\n      - message broker\n      - IoC-Container integration\n      - public git-repo\n      - many more...\n\n      So stay tuned for updates!\n\n\n      Send feedback, feature-request, unexpected breaking changes, etc. via the projects nuget-page, http://www.nuget.org/packages/Blue.MVVM.Lib/ContactOwners, until there is a projet homepage...",

  "releaseNotes": "1.9.5 - version alignment\n      1.9.4 - package does not inlcude assembly Blue.MVVM.Converter anymore (this could lead to errors in non-XAML based apps)\n      1.9.3 - retargeted assemblies for Monoandroid, Xamarinios, MonoTouch\n      1.9.2 - ReleaseBuild\n      1.9.1 - added netcore45 (UWP) as target\n      1.9.0 - Updated target-platforms for portable-specific assemblies, removed dependency to Blue.Utils, updated code-base to leverage C#6 features\n      1.8.2 - ReleaseBuild\n      1.8.1 - Command<T> invokes CanExecuteChanged-Event after execution of the command\n      1.8.0 - Command<T> introduces \"IsReentranceEnabled\" Property to possibly prevent multiple executions of the command, while it is still running. The default behavior is to block reentrancy, which is a breaking change to previos versions, but it can be overriden via Command.IsReentranceEnabledByDefault to restore previous behavior.\n      1.7.2 - Version alignment\n      1.7.1 - Dependency on Blue.Utils 0.5.0\n      1.7.0 - Simplified pacakge-structure, added .NET3.5 support\n      1.7.0-beta1 - Added Events \"Executing\" and \"Executed\" on Command-implementations\n      1.6.1-beta1 - MonoAndroid and MonoTouch Support\n      1.6.0 - Support for extensions by using Boot.Strap Compile-Time-Plugins (currently Blue.MVVM.LoggingModule, Blue.MVVM.ValidationExceptionsModule and Blue.MVVM.CancelOnEqualityModule)\n      - Usage of parameter \"notifyOnChangeOnly\" is deprecated. If you need this behavior, install the according module \"Blue.MVVM.CancelOnEquality\"\n      - upcoming fetaure: imperative and declarative ways to (temporary) deactivate a module\n      1.5.1 - included assemlby for argument validation\n      1.5.0 - internal use of Blue.Utils.ArgumentValidation with support of lambda-expressions to resolve argument names\n      1.4.0 - implemented NotifyPropertyCHangedProxy for use in POCO classes, that canÂ´t inherit a common ViewModel baseclass\n      1.3.7 - targeting support for silverlight 5 and windows phone 8.1\n      1.3.6 - moved internal equality-comparison of NotifyPropertyChangedBase to protected AreEqual-Method, so custom logic can be provided. Default implementation uses EqualityComparery<T> instead of Comparer<T>.\n      1.3.5 - version alignment\n      1.3.4 - WindowsStore-apps references NET 4.5 assemblies\n      1.3.3 - release build\n      1.3.2 - removed extension methods from Raise\n      1.3.1 - PresentationCore gets referenced automatically\n      1.3.0 - inlcuded static class Raise for easier event-raising (may be extracted in seperate package in the future)\n      1.2.0 - changed access modifier of OnPropertyChanged(string) to protected, added OnPropertyChanged<T>(Expression<Func<T>>, for use in e.g. notifications for calculated properties\n      1.1.4 - aligned assembly-versions to package version\n      1.1.3 - adding Blue.MVVM.Lib to projects that target .NET 4.5 now references the 4.5 assemblies instead of 4.0 assemblies\n      1.1.1 - Separated Blue.MVVM and Blue.MVVM.Lib",
