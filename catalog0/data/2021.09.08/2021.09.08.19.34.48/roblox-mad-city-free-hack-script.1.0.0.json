  "description": "Roblox mad city free car codes $ roblox mad city hack script:\n\nMad City hack where your decision is yours to find the power of good or evil. Cause chaos in town streets as a criminal and super villain or join the super heroes and police to create justice to the city. With so many heists, the chaos never stops! Mad City hackis certainly among typically the most popular games in Roblox. My theory is (correct if I'm wrong I only played for 10 min) that Mad City hack is waaaaaay too much of like Jailbreak.
