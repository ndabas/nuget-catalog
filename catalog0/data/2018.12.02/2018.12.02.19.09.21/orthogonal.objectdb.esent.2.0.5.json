  "description": "This library implements an in-process database for storing and retrieving class objects and their property values. The library is designed to be as easy to use as possible, with a small footprint and trivial dependencies. The backing storage is the Microsoft Extensible Storage Engine (ESENT) high-performance, high-capacity, transactional database which is built into all modern versions of Windows. The ObjectDb runtime is implemented as two small managed libraries which are added as project references.",

  "releaseNotes": "This release contains no code changes, it simply removes the AssemblyInformationalVersion attribute from the assembly. The presence of this attribute puts an unacceptable value in the nuspec version variable, which breaks the nuget.org browse results and all uploads after 2.0.1 were invisible and uninstallable. The new packages eventually became visible once the attribute was removed. See: http://gfkeogh.blogspot.com.au/2016/03/nuget-and-assemblyinformationalattribute.html",
