It's easy to fall for San Juan scams especially for those who don't have enough real-life disposable income to spend on Generator. They feel as if they're missing out on game passes and aesthetic items you can get for your San Juan avatar.\nGenerally speaking you’re better off avoiding San Juan account generators. Not only are they unlikely to give you the wealth of riches they promise but they could also land you in trouble with the San Juan Corporation.\nSan Juan has been one of the most popular games over the years. There is a wide range of San Juan games out there each with a unique theme and millions of players playing them every day. \nLikely all kinds since it’s played by more than half of all US kids under 16.\nEqually if you get caught using an account generated through these programs there are big consequences. The official San Juan site strongly advises against using schemes like account generators. They say that anyone asking you to input your details anywhere is scamming you and that you won’t receive a glitched account or San Juan. The terms of service also warn against it too. They say that you cannot obtain “exploited game or experience content.” This includes hacked accounts with Generator. If you’re caught doing this they reserve the right to immediately close your account.\n",
