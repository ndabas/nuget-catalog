  "releaseNotes": "Full Change Log: https://github.com/jcachat/EntityFramework.DynamicFilters/blob/master/src/CHANGELOG.TXT\n\n1.4.9: Fixed filters not being applied to \"ChildCollection.Any()\" condition in .Where clause.  Fixed handling of single property bool conditions in filters (i.e. \"e.BoolFlag\" or \"!e.BoolFlag\").\n1.4.10: Generated SQL now does not include the \"OR (@DynamicFilterParam_1 IS NOT NULL)\" clause if filter is not disabled - fixes bad index usage in some cases on SQL Server.  Will still be included if filter is disabled.  Also fixed some \"contains\" issues with MySql.\n1.4.10.1: Fixed to remove multiple occurrences of filter disabled params (can appear multiple times in complex queries)\n1.4.10.2: Added methods to turn off the enable/disable filter functionality completely so those conditions are not included in sql query at all.\n1.4.10.3: Fixed issues removing disabled filter condition on PostgreSQL\n1.4.11: Signed the assembly\n2.0.0-alpha: Support for filtering on Navigation Properties.  See https://github.com/jcachat/EntityFramework.DynamicFilters/issues/65\n2.0: See https://github.com/jcachat/EntityFramework.DynamicFilters#changes-in-version-2 for changes.\n2.1: Added support for Any() and All() on child collections\n2.2: Fixed SQL generation issue when main query (not filter predicate) contains nullable types.  Added ability to not apply filter to specific types.\n2.3: Fixed issue with entry.Load() on child collections\n2.4: Fixed null exception error on a filter of child property that is also TPT\n2.5: Fixed filtered child property of same type as parent entity builds backwards join condition.  Added support for ?? operator.\n2.6: Fixed issue with filter not applied when defined on derived class involved in TPH.  Fixed filter not applied to navigation property when nav prop is a TPT entity.  Fixed issue with filter on nullable property specified as null via parameter (not delegate).\n2.7: Fixed exception when accessing class in deep inheritance graph\n2.8: Support properties & method references inside filter linq expressions (as constant values, not dynamic), Support child property filters in Oracle 12, Fixed issues caused by removing \"filter is disabled\" claused during sql interception on SQL CE and Oracle DevArt dotConnect providers\n2.8.1: Fixed case problem when checking for Devart Oracle provider",
