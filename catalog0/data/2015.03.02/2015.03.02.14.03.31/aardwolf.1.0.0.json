  "description": "Aardwolf is an asynchronous HTTP API service provider for C# that does not depend on ASP.NET nor IIS. Aardwolf is based on the HttpListener API provided as part of the .NET framework and the Windows implementation makes use of the low-level HTTP.SYS driver to handle and queue HTTP requests in the kernel and forward those to user-mode applications. IIS versions 6 and up make use of this same HTTP.SYS driver so it is a trusted and well-tested component that can be relied upon for production scenarios.\n\nThe Aardwolf framework builds an asynchronous request event loop to handle HTTP requests, taking full advantage of the asynchronous features of the .NET 4.5 framework. A very simple and efficient C# library is exposed to the developer who wants to write fast, asynchronous web services or web sites.\n\nAt this time, the framework is solid and runs very efficiently. However, it is incomplete with regard to features.\n\nIt is not official package created by Alexey Suvorov for your convenience.",
