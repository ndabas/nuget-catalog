It's one of the best games to play when you're bored. What started as a basic Bejeweled clone now vies for your attention and money on the internet, Facebook, and your devices.\n\nEven though Candy Crush is a fremium, it can turn into one of the most expensive habits you'll ever have. The developer, King, can support a free-to-play game like this by selling in-app purchases.\n\nIf you want to climb to the top of the leaderboards without spending a lot of cash, it's essential to take advantage of all the Candy Crush cheats, tips, tricks, and advanced strategies available to you, and we've pulled them all together right here.\n\nCheats in Candy Crush\nWhile there are some ways to cheat the system in Candy Crush, it's imperative to note that services and programs that promise to hack your Candy Crush game or give you free lives, boosters, gold, or anything else, are almost always scams to be avoided.\n\nNever download anything, or sign up for any service from any source that you don't trust, even if it promises to give you free lives or allow you to skip Candy Crush levels. Even if one of these services did work, King could ban your account if it discovers you are using it, and you would lose all your hard work.\n\nImpress your friends and family by beating the online game Candy Crush Saga using this free cheat generator! Download and use this completely free cheat engine to adjust your game score, add unlimited lives, or add unlimited moves. It currently works on Candy Crush Saga with all devices including your iPhone, Android phone, or computer. This software does require you to install Microsoft .NET framework 4 in order to run. But, this is free to download from the Microsoft website.",
