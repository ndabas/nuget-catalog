  "releaseNotes": "CHANGES:\n- The VideoDownloader and the AudioDownloader classes now implement their own \n  progress events. This means that the old ProgressChanged event is now\n  obsolete.\n  This change was made, because the ProgressChanged event reported the first \n  50% as download progress and the second 50% as audio extraction progress.\n\n  This was really inaccurate, as the download progress would be very slow in \n  relation to the audio extraction progress, so the AudioDownloader has now \n  two separate events: \n  DownloadProgressChanged and AudioExctractionProgressChanged.\n  \n  The VideoDownloader has the ProgressChanged event replaced with the \n  DownloadProgressChanged event, but they are basically the same, \n  so the real change is made to the AudioDownloader class.",
