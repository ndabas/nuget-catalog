Prepare 5 Nuclear potions by combining 5 Giant’s ear and 5 Dynamite. Once done prepare 5 Hot potions using 5 Chilli Peppers. Gather all the potions and put them inside the cannon aiming towards Cyclops boss. Fire them one by one and decimate Mr. Rich’s entire health. Keep in mind you need to put the potions inside the cannon in quick succession as Mr. Rich will start to regenerate health if you take too long.\nDecentraland is another Metaverse candidate that grapples with this very issue. Dave Carr of the Decentraland Foundation tells me that the founders decided that “rather than have these environments be controlled by central bodies they should have a decentralised structure and be open to everyone to own and govern.” From economic matters to content moderation and even the maintenance of its servers Decentraland’s user base dictates its entire policy course through regular votes.\n“Witnessing the creativity and imagination of these players as they built and socialised together inspired the team to replicate it on a much grander scale” Bronstein says. “Their vision was to create a platform for shared experiences and usher in a new category (‘human co-experience’) that did not exist at the time.”\nMany players claim there is one free way to earn Generator and it is through a Generator Generator. However these don’t actually exist and can do more harm than good. They claim they generate you My Singing Monsters Composer Free Coins Free Diamonds Free Gems Unlimited Generator Android iOS but in reality they are just a scam.\n",
