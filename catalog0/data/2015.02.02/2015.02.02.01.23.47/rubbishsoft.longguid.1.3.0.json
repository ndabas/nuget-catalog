  "description": "Everyone knows that typical, 128-bit GUIDs are subject to collisions, given enough time. \n\nRubbishsoft has crafted a unique and secure solution to this dilemma with LongGUID by offering 3.94 x 10^115 as much security for your GUIDs by utilizing an industry-leading 512 bits per identifier, as opposed to 128. Your customers will sleep soundly knowing their data will not be subject to duplicates as long as they're within the bounds of our universe. Why offer them anything less? After all, your customers are as unique as this identifier.",
