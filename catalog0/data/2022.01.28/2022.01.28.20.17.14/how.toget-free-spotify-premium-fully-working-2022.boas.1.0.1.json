Free Spotify has recently launched a paid version with more features and functions. This program will generate a unique username for each user based on data collected from the free service and will load the customized profile making use of the musical playlists created by Free Spotify. There are many other similar programs that can be used for various purposes, but none have been developed with the extensive and unique set of capabilities offered by Free Spotify.
