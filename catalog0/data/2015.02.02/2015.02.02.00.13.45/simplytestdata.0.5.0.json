  "description": "Permanent customizations per type can be defined in order to be always applied on-the-fly to objects being created. At the same time any number of additional ad-hoc customizations can be applied in particular test case.\n\nGenerally the syntax is extremely simple. Since every customization is an Action<T> where T is the type of created object. This leads to the very clean and expressive test code.\n\nNote that this micro-framework is NOT opposed to data generation libraries or frameworks such as NBuilder or AutoPoco but can nicely complement them in most of the cases.\n\nFor quick introduction you may want to refer to Getting Started wiki page at https://github.com/igor-toporet/simply-test-data/wiki/Getting-Started",
