  "releaseNotes": "Simple Injector v.3.1.1 is a patch release that fixes two bugs in the core library, one memory leak fix and one related to the diagnostic system.\n\nBug #135 caused a Container instance to keep rooted, and thus prevented the container and all its dependent object from being collected by the GC, in case decorators where applied. This causes a memory leak in applications that create an undefined number of container instances during the lifetime of the application. Do note that in case you are creating many container instances throughout the lifetime of the application, you should call Container.Dispose to prevent the memory leak.\n\nBug #140 prevented the container from detecting an Lifestyle Mismatch in an object graph when calling GetInstance. The problem only appeared in case Verify() was not called, or when objects were resolved that were not registered explicitly (or were registered as open-generic type, while not being referenced as closed-generic type by other registered types). Do note that this bug fix might cause an exception to be thrown in applications that seem to run correctly in v3.1.0, because the Lifestyle Mismatch was not detected before.\n\nSee: https://github.com/simpleinjector/SimpleInjector/releases/tag/v3.1.1",
