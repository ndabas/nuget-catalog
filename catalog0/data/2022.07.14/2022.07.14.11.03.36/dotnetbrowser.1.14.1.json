  "releaseNotes": "This version of the library contains a number of improvements and fixes.\n    \nFixes:\n    \n    The issue when the DotNetBrowser WPF visual component raised an error in the Design mode. This issue was caused by the WPFBrowserView() constructor implementation.\n    The issue when the Browser or BrowserView instance hangs in the different AppDomains. This issue was caused by an issue in the internal IPC module.\n    The issue when the InvalidOperationException exception with the \"Channel is already closed\" message is thrown. This issue was caused by the native crash in the Chromium render process.\n    The issue when the BrowserPreferences.SetChromiumDir() method has no effect on the Release configuration. The issue was related to the inline initialization of the static fields.\n    The issue when some events aren't present in the WinForms Properties window in the Design mode. This issue was caused by the lack of the event attributes. \n    The issue when the custom NetworkDelegate doesn't work after all the Browser or BrowserView instances have been disposed and created again. This issue was caused by an issue in the NetworkService implementation. \n    \nImprovements:\n\n    The available port detection algorithm during the socket initialization has been improved. \n    Logging has been improved.\n    The Browser.OnStartLoadingFrame and Browser.OnProvisionalLoadingFrame events have been improved.\n    The VS 2017 VSIX package compatibility has been added. \n",
