  "description": "A set of extension methods for doing bitwise manipulation such as endianness (bytes<-->integral types) and rotation.\n\nEndianness-related functionality: short, ushort, int, uint, long, ulong : conversion between (to and from) individual items of these and byte arrays, and between arrays of any of these (UInt32[], for example) and byte arrays.\nLittle and big-endian methods exist at feature and/or type parity.\n\nRotation-related functionality: byte, short, ushort, int, uint, long, ulong : left and right bitwise circular rotation (\"rotate no carry\").\nPlease note: the rotation implemented here is NOT \"rotate through carry\"! As such, sign is NOT handled specially for signed types.\n\nEndianness conversions operating on multiple values (bulk operations) are performance-enhanced with optimised 'unsafe' implementations. They are considerably faster than comparable operations provided by the BCL.",

  "releaseNotes": "Added runtime check for system endianness, which controls which methods to use.\n\nFunctionality related to endianness added: all types now have integer array to/from byte array methods (each with its own 'unsafe' high-performance implementations), as well as their own  _NoChecks methods like the rest of the use-modes (e.g. single value conversion vs. batch).\nAlso, Int16/short methods were added.\n\nFunctionality related to rotation added: byte methods.\n\nOptimised avoiding validating arguments as much as possible for performance (don't do it when its totally unnecessary, e.g. using a programatically-defined array where the offset and length are controlled). It really makes a difference in tight loops and the like (if one cannot use the batch processing methods - for example, if a non-linear array access pattern is required).",
