  "description": "This library can be used to develop a .NET application that works as a client of Lightstreamer Server, in order to send and receive real-time data.\n\t\t\t\t The minimum requirements for supported environments are: .NET 4.5, Windows 8, Windows Phone Silverlight 8, ASP.NET Core 1.0.\n\t\t\t\t The Lightstreamer .NET PCL Client Library exposes a simple interface, which enables the application to communicate with the Lightstreamer Server, by opening and closing connections and sessions, performing subscriptions and unsubscriptions, receiving data, and sending client messages to the server.\n\t\t\t\t For complete API documentation: https://www.lightstreamer.com/api/ls-pcl-client/latest/\n\t\t\t\t This client component is compatible with Lightstreamer Server since version 7.0.0 b2.",

  "releaseNotes": "Added two new properties to ConnectionInfo (namely ConnectTimeoutMillis and ReadTimeoutMillis), to enforce timeouts for the socket connection and socket read tasks.\nThis also fixes the documentation of OpenConnection and related methods in LSClient, where it was described a different way to set such timeouts. Actually, this feature was available only in the old .NET SDK and was removed upon the move to the .NET PCL SDK.\nFor a complete summary of changes: https://www.lightstreamer.com/repo/distros/Lightstreamer_7_0_0_b2_20171220.zip%23/Lightstreamer/CHANGELOG.HTML#pcl_client",
