  "releaseNotes": "https://github.com/npgsql/Npgsql/releases/tag/v2.2.0-beta1\n\nMajor highlights\nVisual Studio DDEX support\n\nKenji Uno added support for DDEX. Now you can use Npgsql with Visual Studio data designer. This is a missing feature a lot of our users requested in the past. Kenji added a tutorial about how to use Npgsql with DDEX. You can find it here: https://github.com/npgsql/Npgsql/wiki/Visual-Studio-Design-Time-Support---DDEX-Provider#install-npgsqlddexprovidervsix\nEntity Framework\nDavid Karla≈° added support for EFMigration and Database creation in EF6+\n\nNow it is possible to start Code First projects without needing to create a database upfront. EntityFramework and Npgsql will take care of it.\nEmil Lenngren added support for a lot of missing features of EntityFramework.\n\nA list containing fixes from David and Emil as well as others for EntityFramework can be seen here: https://github.com/npgsql/Npgsql/issues?direction=desc&labels=entity+framework&milestone=2&page=1&sort=created&state=closed\nSSLStream support\n\nIn this release, SSLStream is on by default.\nIf you want to use Mono.Security, you will need to use the following line in your code:\n\nNpgsqlConnection.UseSslStream = false;\n\nNote that in future releases, this option may not be available anymore as we are removing the dependency on Mono.Security assembly. Let us know in the forums if you have any problem with ssl when using SSLStream. This will help us check if we will be able to remove Mono.Security assembly.\nAdded support for JSON, JSONB and HSTORE datatypes\n\nShay added support for those datatypes.\nAdded GSSAPI support on Windows\n\nBrian Crowell added support for GSSAPI on windows. [#170]\nRemoved support for protocol 2\n\nPostgresql versions which use only protocol 2 are very old and don't receive support from postgresql group anymore. By removing this support, we removed a lot of code and can focus on functionalities provided by protocol 3.\nRemoved support for Postgresql 8.3 and below\n\nIn this thread, https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/npgsql-dev/omQ40Eq0HoA, we talked about making Npgsql support the officially supported postgresql versions. This means end of support for postgresql 8.3 and below in the Npgsql 2.2 and up. If you still need support for 7.x, please, use 2.0.x versions. \n",
