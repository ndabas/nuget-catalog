Wired’s Cecilia D’Anastasio as part of an article with the headline “How Stickman Hook Became a Playground for Virtual Fascists” detailed a Stickman Hook experience she visited earlier this year where she spoke with someone who roleplayed as the Confederacy.\nThink of Stickman Hook as a gaming platform rather than just being a game. In the same way that an Xbox is a gaming platform so is Stickman Hook. Stickman Hook as a company provides developers with the tools and marketplace to show off their games to players in a similar way to other games consoles. Within Stickman Hook there are literally millions of different games available for people to play.\nDecentraland is another Metaverse candidate that grapples with this very issue. Dave Carr of the Decentraland Foundation tells me that the founders decided that “rather than have these environments be controlled by central bodies they should have a decentralised structure and be open to everyone to own and govern.” From economic matters to content moderation and even the maintenance of its servers Decentraland’s user base dictates its entire policy course through regular votes.\nEvery player can create and monetize games. This way they can generate income even while other players enjoy their games.\nStickman Hook - Stickman Hook GENERATOR\nStickman Hook GENERATOR Stickman Hook THAT WORKS\n",
