  "description": "Aspose.3D is a class library for working with 3D files. It allows developers to create new 3D scene and work with FBX,STL,OBJ,3DS files. It allows you to open files and manipulate the elements in the 3D scene, from line,mesh,nurbs curve, to more complex elements animation, and then export to FBX ASCII, FBX binary, STL ASCII, STL binary, Wavefront .obj and 3DS formats.",
