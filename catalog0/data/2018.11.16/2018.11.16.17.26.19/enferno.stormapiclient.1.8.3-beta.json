  "releaseNotes": "What's new?\n\n      CustomerService:  \n      - #10132 A new method, GetCustomerByCode has been added.\n      https://servicesstage.enferno.se/api/1.1/docs/#/Customers/Operations/GetCustomerByCode\n\n      - #10100 Flags have now been added to Company and PricelistIds have been added to Customer. https://servicesstage.enferno.se/api/1.1/docs/#/Customers/Entities/Company\n      https://servicesstage.enferno.se/api/1.1/docs/#/Customers/Entities/Customer\n\n      ProductService:  \n      - #9958 IsBuyable has been added to ProductPrice and is false if the product is closed or if the sku itself is not buyable.\n\n      ShoppingService: \n      - # 10112 A new property, IsPriceManual, on BasketItem. Used when setting price on BasketItem with UpdateBasketItem or when using InsertBasketItem. When setting prices, set BasketItem.Price to the correct price and BasketItem.IsPriceManual to true. To revert to the original price just set IsPriceManual = false.\n       \n      What's fixed?\n\n      ProductService:  \n      - #9958 IsBuyable on ProductItem/Product now behaves equally and is now false if the product is closed. Previously it was only false if the product had IsBuyable = false. Products with IsBuyable = true that are closed will show as not buyable.\n\n      ShoppingService:  \n      - #9958 IsBuyable on BasketItem is now false if the product is closed. Previously it was only false if the product had IsBuyable = false. Products with IsBuyable = true that are closed will show as not buyable.\n\n      - #10007 The reservation logic for OnHand in the Checkout now ignores products of type virtual, except when the virtual product is a structure item. Then the reservation is made on the included items.\n\n      - #10110 Problem with promotions with multiple effects where the effects matched more than one basketitem has now been fixed. Previously just the first effect was applied.\n\n       \n      Miscellaneous changes? \n\n      ShoppingService:  \n      - #10007 The reservation logic for OnHand in the Checkout now ignores products of type virtual, except when the virtual product is a structure item. Then the reservation is made on the included items.\n\n\n      Feedback?\n      Faults and strange behavior can be reported to support@enferno.se or to patrik.rosquist@enferno.se.\n       \n       \n      Regards,\n      The Storm API Team",
