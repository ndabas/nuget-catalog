Any car with a star on it is locked behind the Premium Pass which will cost 250 Generator.\nThe Apple vs Epic Games trial which took place in May and whose verdict is expected later this year could wind up being just the first of many similar clashes. The court battle started last year when Apple removed Epic’s Fortnite from its App Store after the developer had engineered a system to prevent Apple from taking a 30 per cent commission on Fortnite sales to iPhone users. Epic’s defence was couched in the language of worry about how Apple’s behaviour could affect and shape an emerging Metaverse.\nDuring a recent developer QA Splitgate developers announced that they are working on an update that will bring Splitgate to Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5. We don’t know much else at this point and there is no release window announced but we expect the Splitgate upgrade will have a smoother framerate than the Splitgate PS4 and Xbox One versions have currently. 1047 Games also mentioned possibilities of versions on Switch Mac and mobile but the studio hasn’t begun any work for such versions yet.\n",
