There is a wide range of Beat Stomper games out there each with a unique theme and millions of players playing them every day. \nThe Apple vs Epic Games trial which took place in May and whose verdict is expected later this year could wind up being just the first of many similar clashes. The court battle started last year when Apple removed Epic’s Fortnite from its App Store after the developer had engineered a system to prevent Apple from taking a 30 per cent commission on Fortnite sales to iPhone users. Epic’s defence was couched in the language of worry about how Apple’s behaviour could affect and shape an emerging Metaverse.\nBeat Stomper is one of those games that seems to have been around forever. The free-to-play multiplayer game has been a hit with kids and adults alike for years. However the allure of Beat Stomper account generators has always been strong. Supposedly they’ll create an account loaded with free bonus items and a stash of Generator to spend on items. This leaves one big question – are free account generators safe to use\nIf you're not already logged in log in to your Beat Stomper account.
