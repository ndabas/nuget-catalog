  "description": "The goal of AtomicMVVM is to allow developers to work with MVVM in their XAML based solutions (XPF, Silverlight, Windows Phone, WinRT) with minimal effort while not getting in the way of the code. It requires .NET 4 or higher. The design goals of AtomicMVVM are (in order): simple over feature rich, unobtrusive over less code and convention over configuration.",

  "releaseNotes": "3.0.0 - Significant changes to how the boot strapper works\nCan no longer pass in commands to the boot strapper constructor (work done in 1.0.11).\nYou must call the Start method to start the binding.\nAdded support (finally) for Windows Phone 7.1 â€“ not that it was a good idea.\nSwitched from Mercurial to Git.\nMassive amounts of clean up to the WinRT version.\n      2.0.1 - Updated to support Visual Studio \"11\" & Windows 8 Consumer Preview changes to Metro style app changes.\n\t\t\t2.0.0 - Changed the way attributes (Trigger & Reevaluate) work. No longer can you do multiple. Now you can only have one, but with multiple properties. This solves some edge case bugs & improves performance. Added small tweak around warning of unused event. Create the 'Views' & 'ViewModels' folder for you. \n\t\t\t1.0.11 - Bug fixes for WinRT command support (grr) and ability to pass in global commands in the constructor so they can be applied to the first view too.\n\t\t\t1.0.10 - Improved the Nuget package quality (and managed to knock off about 90% of the file size too) and published a symbols version.\n\t\t\t1.0.9 - Updated Nuget with a different icon.\n\t\t\t1.0.8 - Updated Nuget with icon.\n\t\t\t1.0.7 - Bug fixes for Metro & Silverlight 5 support\n\t\t\t1.0.6 - Added support for .NET 4.5, Silverlight 5 & Metro in NuGet package\n\t\t\t1.0.5 - Added support for non-default view constructors which allows for data passing. Added support for global app commands.\n\t\t\t1.0.4 - Building for .NET 4 client profile now (rather than 4.5 as was doing).\n\t\t\t1.0.3 - Doesn't help if I don't include the updated assembly. So this is 1.0.2 proper.\n\t\t\t1.0.2 - Updated project to be the bitbucket site. Helps if I make classes public (doh). Added trigger property logic.\n\t\t\t1.0.1 - Fixed bug in the type location.\n\t\t\t1.0.0 - First release.",
