  "description": "Why?\n\nBecause the nuget designers wrongly disallow creation of a nuget that has nothing.  You must have at least a dependency or content.  So here are some content folders, which contain nothing.  \n\nI had a legitimately need for a nuget with nothing, as I was using it as a seed from which I was going to update to a later version which contains something.   So my personal choice is to not have those empty content folders, but for laughs create a seed nuget that had a dependency on  \"Nuget.Of.Nothing\".",
