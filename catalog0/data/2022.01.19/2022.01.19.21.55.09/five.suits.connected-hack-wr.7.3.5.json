The trick is knowing where to appear.\nIt’s a platform where you can play millions of different... experiences... specifically created for the platform. A vast majority of those experiences are games but you can also do things like attend concerts or visit Stranger Things’ Starcourt Mall re-created in Five Suits Connected.
