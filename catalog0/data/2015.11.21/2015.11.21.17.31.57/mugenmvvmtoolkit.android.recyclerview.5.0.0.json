  "releaseNotes": "Breaking changes:\n      - Changed arguments of all fluent binding methods from (model) => model.Name to (model, ctx) => mode.Name, where the ctx argument is IBindingSyntaxContext interface that allows to use the specific binding extension methods instead of direct use BindingSyntaxEx class (Binding).\n      - Changed the management and the creation of IocContainer for view models (Core).\n      - Changed return value in the IToastPresenter.ShowAsync method to the IToast interface instead of the Task class (Core).\n      -

Added IsInitialized property to the IMvvmApplication.\n      - Added the GetViewAsync method with IViewMappingItem parameter to the IViewManager interface.\n      - Added PlatformType.WinRTPhone and PlatformType.XamarinFormsWinRTPhone constants.\n      - Changed the ItemsSource property type from IList<T> to INotifiableCollection<T> in IGridViewModel and IMultiViewModel interfaces.\n      - Now the SuspendNotifications method suspends properties and collection notifications for the GridViewModel class.\n      - Now all bootstrappers return by default all assemblies without a filter.\n      - Now the WindowViewMediatorBase class invokes the OnNavigatingFrom method.\n\nBinding:\n      - Added interpolated strings support (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn961160.aspx).\n      - Added the ability to clear source value for binding if it implements IDisposable interface.\n      - Added null check when invoke an instance method.\n      - Added automatic registration of all implementations of the IDataTempateSelector interface.\n      -

Added BindingServiceProvider.DisableConverterAutoRegistration and BindingServiceProvider.DisableDataTemplateSelectorAutoRegistration properties.\n      - Added the AttachedBindingMember.TrySetRaiseAction method that allows to set action that is invoked by INotifiableAttachedBindingMemberInfo.Raise method.\n      - Replaced the 'Format' method from resource method call to string.Format() method call.\n      - Reduced memory usage for 'src' and 'self' resources.\n      - Changed algorithm of methods resolution for dynamic methods.\n      -

Added the RestoreSelectedIndex attached member for TabLayout.\n      - Added the RestoreSelectedIndex attached member for TabHost and ViewPager.\n      - Added the DisableHierarchyListener attached member for ViewGroup that allows to remove the default IOnHierarchyChangeListener.\n      -
