  "description": "ChemBytes Draw is a compact .NET component allowing developers to integrate advanced chemical drawing and chemical information processing into any  .NET project (WPF or Windows Forms).\n\nThis is a 30 day evaluation version, which later can be unlocked. No registration required.\n\nAs part of a .NET application, ChemBytes Draw on demand displays a fully featured chemical drawing editor, which also supports organometallic, polymer and peptide drawing. Content can be imported from other third party chemical drawing tools, e.g. ISIS/Symyx/Accelrys Draw, ChemDraw, Marvin, etc., via MDL clipboard content or via MDL format export files, including V3000 format. When the user closes the editor, the API takes over and exposes the chemical information for use by your own application. Thus, the molecular weights and elemental formulas of all entered reactants and products, their InChIKeys, bitmap and vector images, bounding boxes, the MDL reaction and molfiles, and the internal file format for database storage, etc. are available for further processing. ChemBytes Draw is written in 100% managed code, i.e. it is no wrapper around an existing Java or C++ functionality.\n\nA sample Visual Studio project and sample files are available from the project site.",
