  "description": "This project was created to help the developers work with the Asp.Net MCV and Telerik MVC Grid coupled with some mapping technique between the Entities and ViewModels.\n\nIf you're one of us, you have to use the CustomBinding to query the database, reporting the criteria for sort, group and filter the income data, and then convert back the result to the ViewModels.\n\nSounds simple, but can become a very complicated and repetitive task.\n\nSo I, with the help of some comrades of development, have created a way to automate this in a very generic way.\n\nBefore using this, some observations;\n\nThis code is highly experimental and has no guarantee that works perfectly in all cases.\nIt was developed on top of NHibernate, but could works with another ORM tool\nCredits and other informationâ€™s here: www.telerik.com/community/forums/aspnet-mvc/grid/how-to-use-custombinding-with-viewmodel.aspx\nIf you prefer, you can find the Nuget package here: https://nuget.org/packages/TelerikMvcGridCustomBindingHelper\n\nThat's it for now, I hope you enjoy.\n\nSorry for my bad (auto-translated) English.",
