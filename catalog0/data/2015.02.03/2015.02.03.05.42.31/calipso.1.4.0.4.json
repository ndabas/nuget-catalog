  "releaseNotes": "NOTE: This release has the same features of 1.4.0.3. It is a NuGet package fix (the Web.config transformation file was missing and Calipso was not configure at all when the package was installed!).\n      \n      Primarily, this release is a refactoring in order to work on top of the newly-released jOOPL 2.0.1 (http://joopl.codeplex.com) and its improvement in terms of client-side JavaScript object-oriented\n      programming and its new features on top of ECMA-Script 5 and above.\n\n      In the other hand, there were some bugs that have been fixed:\n      - Some strange behaviors with JavaScript and CssManager ended up in unhandled exceptions. Now, this has been fixed.\n      - Because some previous changes, CssManager stopped to work when not using UI themes. This has been fixed too.\n\n      Some improvements in the JavaScript code base:\n      - All infrastructure JavaScript code is working in strict mode from now, and it is encloused into self-invoked functions in order to avoid naming collisions.\n\n      Important note: as many JavaScript code has been refactored to work with jOOPL 2.0, JavaScript classes relying on previous version of ASP.NET Calipso will have to be refactored too in order to take advantage of the\n      new $def keyword and the new way of declaring classes and interfaces (see how does $def work on http://joopl.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Classes&referringTitle=Documentation).\n\n      If you find a lot of problems migrating to newer versions of ASP.NET Calipso, please open a discussion on the official CodePlex site: http://calipso.codeplex.com/discussions\n\n      ASP.NET Calipso has a new official API reference page! Check it now on http://aspnetcalipso.com/docs\n\n      Enjoy!",
