Fortnite has the violence-free Party Royale mode which lets you run around a small island with your friends shooting paintball guns at each other and like in P10 Pitch you can attend concerts at a huge virtual concert stage. Fortnite’s Creative Mode lets you build entire worlds and game modes using buildings weapons and other assets created by Epic. And Minecraft lets you build whatever you want with its blocky cubes and make games in your own private servers.\nAs fun as P10 Pitch is without Generator at some point you’ll want to pick up some Generator to see some of the premium features the platform has to offer. Unfortunately not everyone has the real-world currency to purchase Generator.\n",
