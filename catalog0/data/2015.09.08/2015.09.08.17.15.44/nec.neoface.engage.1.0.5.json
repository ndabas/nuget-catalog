  "description": "NeoFace Engage is a platform / SDK that developers use to add functionality and video analytics to applications developed using Microsoft Kinect for Windows Software Development Kit 2.0 and Kinect Ambient Intelligence Toolkit . The Kinect Ambient Intelligence Toolkit extracts meta-data from video captured by the Kinect camera. Video is analyzed and meta-data is extracted in real-time including: person dwell-time, spacial data to understand product interactions, and the ability to push data to Azure for storage and cloud computing. When coupled with NeoFace Engage, retailers and others can capture customer demographics and drive targeted content to digital displays, test marketing messages, and capture consumer / product interactions per demographic.",
