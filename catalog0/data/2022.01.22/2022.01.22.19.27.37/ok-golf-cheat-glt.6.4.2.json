Therefore you have to make sure you find the promo codes for the correct month and use them before the next one arrives.\nThe games can vary massively in terms of quality and content and there appears to be very little quality control from OK Golf themselves. This doesn’t mean that all of the games are bad there are thousands of amazing games to play on the platform but it can sometimes take a bit of digging to separate the good from the bad.\nGenerally speaking you’re better off avoiding OK Golf account generators. Not only are they unlikely to give you the wealth of riches they promise but they could also land you in trouble with the OK Golf Corporation.\nGems are a completely new currency added to Wacky Wizards in OK Golf. While players can pay for these by spending their Generator from the store it’s also possible to get your hands on them for free. In this guide we’ll explain how to get Gems in Wacky Wizards so you can get spending to your heart’s content.\n",
