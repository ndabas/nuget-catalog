  "description": "This class is for .NET7 and is a port of DataJuggler.Net for the .Net Framework, which is used by \nDataTier.Net and DB Compare to read SQL Server database schema and code generate stored procedure\ndriven data tiers.\n\nBreaking Change: Now that this project uses Microsoft.Data.SqlClient 5.0, connection strings must\nset Encrypt = False if your database is not encrypted. \n\nThe two main classes are:\nSQLDatabaseConnector - A wrapper for SqlDatabaseConnection that reads database schema.\n\nCSharpClassWriter - A class that is useful in code generating C# classes.",

  "releaseNotes": "7.22.2023: CSharpClassWriter was updated for DataJuggler.Excelerate. All other functionality should be the same.\n\n\t\t7.16.2023: DataJuggler.Cryptography was updated to 7.1.0, as the constructor for Rfc2898DeriveBytes was\n\t\tdeemed obsolete. Also DataJuggler.UltimateHelper was updated to verison 7.1.3.\n\n\t\t4.11.2023: I added a new delegate ProgressStatusCallback that can be passed into the LoadDataTablesData method\n\t\tto receive callbacks during long operations. I also put a try catch around LoadDataRowsWithoutBinaryData method\n\t\tso that if one table or view has a problem the others are not affected.\n\n\t\t7.16.2023: DataJuggler.Cryptography was updated to 7.1.0, as the constructor for Rfc2898DeriveBytes was\n\t\tdeemed obsolete.\n\n\t\t4.1.2023: Everyone who likes this project on Git Hub will receive 3 good luck wishes.\n\t\tResults may vary.\n\n\t\t11.15.2022: I added TargetFrameworkEnum to this library. This enum is used by DataTier.Net\n\t\tand DataJuggler.Excelerate to determine the references to include.\n\n\t\t11.8.2022\n\t\tv7.0.1: This project has been updated for .NET 7.0. Use DataJuggler.Net6 for for .NET6.\n\n\t\t10.19.2022 (Take Two):\n\t\tv7.0.1-rc1: I added an optional parameter to the BuildConnectionString methods, so that the\n\t\tconnectionstrings will ad Encrypt=False unless the user passes in true for Encrypt.\n\n\t\t10.19.2022:\n\t\tv7.0.0-rc1 - The biggest breaking change so far is I updated Microsoft.Data.SqlClient to version 5.1.x (preview for now)\n\t\tthat I skipped on version 6 of this library. Last time there were too many breaking changes for me to handle a change\n\t\tto connection strings. I am attempting to fix that this year.\n\n\t\t8.5.2022 v6.2.0: I now compare and script DefaultValueCheckConstraints and Foreign Key check\n\t\tconstraints. After working on one of my databases I realized constraints that have No Check\n\t\tare not working. Still the Generate Scripts is saving me time as it improves.\n\n\t\t6.17.2022 v6.1.4: I updated DataJuggler.Cryptography package.\n\n\t\t6.8.2022: I updated DataJuggler.Cryptography package.\n\n\n\t\t4.18.2022: After only 18 years, I discovered that I the data type Date in SQL Server was not mapped.\n\t\tI always use DateTime, but I have a project with just Date data type and realized this isn't parsed.\n\t\tOne of the advantages of being unpopular is no one sees my mistakes.\n\n\t\t4.14.2022: I added two properties to DataTable and StoredProcedure classes, to keep track of\n\t\tUsesAnsiNulls and UseQuotedIdentifiers. I now set these objects when I load the DatabaseSchema.\n\t\tIt turns out, the text for the Defition of the View or Stored Procedure already had this, so not\n\t\treally needed. Generate Scripts now creates missing fields, tables, views and stored procedures.\n\t\tNext is constraints and keys and that is 99% of all updates I do.\n\n\t\t4.13.2022: I added a new method to SQL Database Connector to get the text for a view. This was needed for\n\t\tDB Compare had a bug when it tried to generate sql for a view. Tables are easy, views I had to get the actual text\n\t\tto make sure all the joins are correct.\n\n\t\t12.31.2021\n\t\tVersion 6.0.1: I upgraded the reference to Microsoft.Data.SqlClient to 4.0.0. Turns out this breaks everything without encrypt =false,\n\t\tso I took this out.\n\n\t\t3.0.6: I added a new property called CreatedFilePaths. This list of strings will contain the full path of all\n\t\tfiles created during WriteClasses method.\n\n\t\tAlso, I found out why I had problems with Nuget version 3.0.2 - 3.0.5. I had a project reference and a Nuget reference, and Nuget and / or Visual Studio didn't like it.\n\n\t\tVersion 3.0.5: I updated the Read Me about a new project that uses CSharpClassWriter.\n\n\t\tVersion 3.0.4: Not sure why, but Nuget was giving me warning on 3.0.3 version. Trying again.\n\n\t\tVersion 3.0.3: I made a few changes to CSharpClassWriter to make it easier to code generate from outside DataTier.Net. My project DataJuggler.Excelerate now has a code generator, so the header row in an Excel sheet\n\t\tcan be used to create a class.\n\n\t\tVersion 3.0.1: I created a default constructor for CSharpClassWriter, so it is not only for DataTier.Net\n\n\t\tUpdate 9.15.2021\n\t\tVersion 3.0.2: I added DataType object for code generation outside of DataTier.Net.\n\n\t\tVersion 3.0.0: I changed out System.Data.SqlClient to Microsoft.Data.SqlClient, so I updated this package to\n\t\tversion 3.0.0 to be the same version as Microsoft.Data.SqlClient.\n\n\t\tVersion 2.5.1: I added 2 new methods to SQLDatabaseConnector for FindTable and FindTableIndex. It surprises me this doesn't exist somewhere in the app.\n\n\t\tVersion 2.5.0: This version converted the .Net Core version to .Net 5. All the different names confuse even me, so I am trying to get down to everything I keep working on is .Net 5.\n\n\t\tI added new properties named Tag to DataField, DataRow and DataTable classes. I use these fields in a new\n\t\tproject I am working on called DataDiff, which will be used to find changes before and after something happens.\n\n\t\tI updated the reference to System.Data.SqlClient to 4.8.0\n\t\tI updated the reference to DataJuggler.UltimateHelper.Core to version 1.1.4",
