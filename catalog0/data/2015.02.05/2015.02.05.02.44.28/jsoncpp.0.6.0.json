  "releaseNotes": "New in JsonCpp 0.6.0:\n  ---------------------\n\n* Compilation\n\n  - LD_LIBRARY_PATH and LIBRARY_PATH environment variables are now \n    propagated to the build environment as this is required for some \n    compiler installation.\n\n  - Added support for Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 (bug #2930462): \n    The platform 'msvc90' has been added.\n\n    Notes: you need to setup the environment by running vcvars32.bat \n    (e.g. MSVC 2008 command prompt in start menu) before running scons.\n    \n  - Added support for amalgamated source and header generation (a la sqlite).\n    Refer to README.txt section 'Generating amalgamated source and header'\n    for detail.\n    \n* Value\n\n  - Removed experimental ValueAllocator, it caused static \n    initialization/destruction order issues (bug #2934500). \n    The DefaultValueAllocator has been inlined in code.\n    \n  - Added support for 64 bits integer:\n  \n    Types Json::Int64 and Json::UInt64 have been added. They are aliased\n  to 64 bits integers on system that support them (based on __int64 on \n  Microsoft Visual Studio platform, and long long on other platforms).\n  \n  Types Json::LargestInt and Json::LargestUInt have been added. They are\n  aliased to the largest integer type supported: \n  either Json::Int/Json::UInt or Json::Int64/Json::UInt64 respectively.\n  \n  Json::Value::asInt() and Json::Value::asUInt() still returns plain\n  'int' based types, but asserts if an attempt is made to retrieve\n  a 64 bits value that can not represented as the return type.\n  \n  Json::Value::asInt64() and Json::Value::asUInt64() have been added\n  to obtain the 64 bits integer value.\n  \n  Json::Value::asLargestInt() and Json::Value::asLargestUInt() returns\n  the integer as a LargestInt/LargestUInt respectively. Those functions\n  functions are typically used when implementing writer.\n  \n  The reader attempts to read number as 64 bits integer, and fall back\n  to reading a double if the number is not in the range of 64 bits \n  integer.\n    \n    Warning: Json::Value::asInt() and Json::Value::asUInt() now returns\n    long long. This changes break code that was passing the return value\n    to *printf() function.\n  \n    Support for 64 bits integer can be disabled by defining the macro \n  JSON_NO_INT64 (uncomment it in json/config.h for example), though\n  it should have no impact on existing usage.\n    \n  - The type Json::ArrayIndex is used for indexes of a JSON value array. It\n    is an unsigned int (typically 32 bits).\n  \n  - Array index can be passed as int to operator[], allowing use of literal:\n    Json::Value array;\n  array.append( 1234 );\n  int value = array[0].asInt();  // did not compile previously\n\n  - Added float Json::Value::asFloat() to obtain a floating point value as a\n    float (avoid lost of precision warning caused by used of asDouble() \n    to initialize a float).\n\n* Reader\n\n  - Renamed Reader::getFormatedErrorMessages() to getFormattedErrorMessages.\n    Bug #3023708 (Formatted has 2 't'). The old member function is deprecated\n    but still present for backward compatibility.\n    \n* Tests\n\n  - Added test to ensure that the escape sequence '\\/'' is corrected handled \n    by the parser.\n\n* Bug fixes\n\n  - Bug #3139677: JSON [1 2 3] was incorrectly parsed as [1, 3]. Error is now \n    correctly detected.\n    \n  - Bug #3139678: stack buffer overflow when parsing a double with a\n    length of 32 characters.\n  \n  - Fixed Value::operator <= implementation (had the semantic of operator >=).\n    Found when addigin unit tests for comparison operators.\n    \n  - Value::compare() is now const and has an actual implementation with\n    unit tests.",
