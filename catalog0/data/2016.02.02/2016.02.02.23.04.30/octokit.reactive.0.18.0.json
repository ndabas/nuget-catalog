  "releaseNotes": "New: support for User Administration API (GitHub Enterprise) - #1068 via @paladique\nNew: support for Admin Stats API (GitHub Enterprise) - - #1049 via @ryangribble\nNew: support for Repository Pages API - #1061 via @M-Zuber\nNew: get stargazer creation timestamps - #1060 via @daveaglick\nNew: support for Protected Branches API - #996 via @ryangribble\nNew: support for creating Personal Access Tokens - #990 via @alfhenrik\nFixed: `Milestone` property added to `PullRequest` response - #1075 via @Eilon\nFixed: Add member role filter to `OrganizationMembersClient.GetAll()` - #1072 via @ryangribble\nFixed: `Repository.Content.GetAllContents` now support the root of the repository - #1064 via @naveensrinivasan, @shiftkey\nFixed: added `Id` and `Locked` to `Issue`, added `CommitUrl` to `IssueEvent` - #1039 via @gabrielweyer\nFixed: additional fields on `Release` and `ReleaseAsset` - #1009 via @gabrielweyer\nFixed: `ApiException` now includes JSON payload when `.ToString()`- #974 via @asizikov\nBreaking Changes:**\nAs part of reaching 1.0 we went through to audit the current implementation\nand identify areas that didn't align with our conventions. For this release,\nwe're marking the endpoints as `[Obsolete]` and indicating the new location.\nThese will be cleaned up in the next release:\n- `IGitHubClient.Notifications` -> `IGitHubClient.Activity.Notifications` - #1019 via @M-Zuber\n- `IGitHubClient.Repository.CommitStatus` -> `IGitHubClient.Repository.Status` - #1043 via @RobPethick\n- `IGitHubClient.Repository.Commits` -> `IGitHubClient.Repository.Commit` - #1057 via @M-Zuber\n- `IGitHubClient.Repository.RepoCollaborators` -> `IGitHubClient.Repository.Collaborator` - #1040 via @M-Zuber\n- `IGitHubClient.Repository.RepositoryComments` -> `IGitHubClient.Repository.Comment` - #1044 via @M-Zuber\n- `IGitHubClient.Release` -> `IGitHubClient.Repository.Release` - #1058 via @RobPethick\n- `IGitHubClient.GitDatabase` -> `IGitHubClient.Git` - #1048 via @RobPethick\nOther breaking changes:\n- a public `ApiExtensions.Get<T>` extension method was causing a bunch of\ntests to be written in a confusing way. This has been ported to an interface\nmethod on `IApiConnection` but hopefully you're not referencing this method\nexternally - see #1063 for more information.\n- `IRepositoryContentsClient.GetArchiveLink` is no longer correct, as the HTTP\nbehaviour in Octokit was updated to follow redirects received from the server.\nSee #986 for the last bits of cleanup.\n- `IRepositoryContentsClient.GetAllContents(string owner, string name, string path, string reference)`\nhas been renamed to `GetAllContentsByRef(string owner, string name, string path, string reference)`\nto prevent overlap with methods on `IRepositoryContentsClient` which do not\nspecify a path - and thus look at the root of the repository.\n- `IssueEventPayload` has two fields which are never populated from the API -\n`Assignee` and `Label` - these are now removed. You should use\n`Issue.Assignee` and `Issue.Labels` instead. See #1039 for more details.\n- `PullRequest.MergeCommitSha` is marked as obsolete by the GitHub API - we\nare cleaning up the behaviour for determining whether a PR has been\nmerged in #997 - see the PR for more information.\n- `IAuthorizationsClient.RevokeAllApplicationAuthentications` is no longer\navailable through the GitHub API - this will be removed in the next\nrelease.\nShout outs**\nA lot of extra work went into this release, and I wanted to thank those people\nwho helped out - without their efforts we wouldn't be at this point:\n- @naveensrinivasan - for helping set up our Travis CI builds to test this on\nMono - see #995 for the details\n- @hahmed - for contributing a bunch of documentation around the Octokit search\nAPIs - see #955, #954 and #951\n- @JakesCode - for clarifying some documentation after he reported an issue - #1054\n- @ryangribble - for helping get our GitHub Enterprise testing off the ground - #987\n- @naveensrinivasan - for catching and addressing an issue with our LINQPad snippets - #987",
