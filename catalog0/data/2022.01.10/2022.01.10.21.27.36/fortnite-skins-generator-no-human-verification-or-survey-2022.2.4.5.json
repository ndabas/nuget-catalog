And keep making that victory royales until you own every single one of them or until you have earned enough V-bucks to purchase the one you love.\n\nFortnite categories explanation There are a lot of different items available within Fortnite. All items do belong to one of the following six categories The background color of the square will change based on the rarity of the generated item.\n\nYou have to follow a stepwise guide in Fortnite Skin Generator to get free skin.
