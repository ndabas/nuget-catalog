  "description": "This package works with Windows Azure Service Bus and provides a C# based durable Task framework for writing long running applications. It adds Microsoft.ServiceBus.DurableTask.dll along with related libraries to your project. Additional info for Durable Tasks is at http://aka.ms/l7283l,\n      Please note that this package requires .Net Framework 4.5.",

  "releaseNotes": "- Added OrchestrationStateQuery user model with in-memory implementation\n      - Sorted results returned by TaskHubClient.GetOrchestrationHistory() by event timestamps\n      - Added pagination for OrchestrationStateQuery results\n      - Added async methods to TaskHubClient\n      - OrchestrationContext.ContinueAsNew now has an overload that takes the desired version of the new generation\n      - OrchestrationContext.CreateSuborchestrationXXX methods have overloads that take an explicit Instance Id to use as the instance id for the suborchestration\n      - Fixed null ref in tracing when terminating an orchestration\n      - Added more resilience against Service Bus clock skew\n      - Fail the orchestation on detection of non-deterministic workflow\n      - Remove explicit retries for service bus operations (sb client does that)\n      - Log critical error if delivery count if it gets near the maxdeliverycount\n      - Terminate orchestration with appropriate message if session size grows above 230k.\n      - Added backoff on messagingexceptions even while processing work items\n      - Increase Max delivery count on taskhub queues, make it configurable.\n      - Log message stats if tracking dispatcher write fails\n      - Abandon messages properly in the tracking dispatcher (similar to what we do in the orchestration dispatcher)\n      - Added TaskHubWokerSettings option that gives users access to concurrency of TaskOrchestration, TaskActivity and Tracking dispatchers\n      (concurrent items + backoff etc)\n      - Orchestration state compression can be specified via the TaskHubWorkerSettings object. Turned off by default. This helps write more complex orchestrations\n      without running into the session state size limit.\n      - Fixed bug in Tracking dispatcher which causes failure when dumping a history event larger than 32K to a column in the Azure table store.\n      - Fixes a critical regression in 0.2.0.13 that caused sessions in service bus to never get deleted even when orchestrations were terminated. Also added\n      tests to catch this regression in the future.\n      - Added TaskHubWorker.CreateHub(bool createInstanceStore) overload that would let users control whether they want to drop and recreate the instance store\n      along with the task hub queues.\n      - Adds message level compression and associated options to control compression and threshold in TaskHubWorkerSettings and TaskHubClientSettings.\n      - Removes batching for Send operations within the TaskOrchestrationDispatcher's transaction block. Reason was that message batches are bundled up into a single\n      batch message which has to follow the 256KB message size limit thus limiting the response size for task activities or the complexity of the orchestrations.\n      - Fix bug with RetryOptions when TimeSpan.Zero is passed in as firstRetryInterval\n      - Fix bug with tracking dispatcher failing to truncate larger history entities when writing to the Azure table based instance store\n      - Added a PurgeOrchestrationInstanceHistoryAsync method on TaskHubClient which enables users to purge older orchestration instance histories from the instance \n      store. This relieves pressure on instance queries.",
