  "description": "Web Rule is an ASP.NET and MVC server component that allows creation, modification, validation and evaluation of complex business rules, as well as creation and execution of complex rule-based data filters for virtually all established LINQ providers. Using its web interface, business users can create rules or filters by selecting options from a series of context-sensitive drop-down menus. This IntelliSense-like approach is unique to web-based business rule management. With Web Rule integrated into your project, the most complex business rules can be authored without any knowledge of programming languages.",
