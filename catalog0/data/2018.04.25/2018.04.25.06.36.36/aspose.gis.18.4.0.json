  "description": "Aspose.GIS for .NET is a library that enables your applications to work with popular geospatial file formats. It supports working with the popular vector file formats. The API lets you create, read and convert documents without the requirement of any other commercial software.\n      Aspose.GIS is a single .NET assembly that can be deployed with any .NET application by simply copying it.\n\n      Features Overview\n\n      Single API to work with vector geospatial file formats without worrying about underlying implementation of these.\n\n      Supported File Formats\n\n        -\tESRI Shapefile\n        -\tGeoJSON\n        -\tKML (Keyhole Markup Language)\n\n      Work with Vector Data\n\n        -\tCreate new files with your vector data.\n        -\tRead features from existing files.\n        -\tRetrieve attributes information.\n        -\tGet features count in a file.\n        -\tIterate over all features of a layer.\n        -\tGet values of feature attributes from a layer.\n        -\tFilter features by attribute value.\n        -\tExtract features from a Shapefile and export to GeoJSON format.\n        -\tSpecify attribute value length.\n        -\tCheck feature for null values.\n        -\tConvert polygon shapefile to linestring shapefile.\n\n      Work with Geometries\n\n        -\tWork with several Geometries.\n        -\tCreate Points and Multipoint geometry types.\n        -\tGenerate Line and Line Strings with specified geographic information.\n        -\tDefine Polygon and MultiPolygon geometry shape.\n        -\tCreate Polygons with holes.\n        -\tGet information of Geometry types.\n        -\tCount geometries in a geometry shape.\n        -\tIterate over Points contained in Geometry.\n\n      Work with Spatial Reference systems\n\n        -\tCreate vector layers with a spatial reference system.\n        -\tSet desired spatial reference system when converting between layers.\n        -\tTransform geometries between spatial reference systems.\n        -\tImport spatial reference systems from WKT, export spatial reference systems to WKT.\n\n      Convert between GIS File Formats\n\n        -\tInterconvert between all supported formats.\n        -\tAdjust feature attributes during conversion.\n\n      Performance and Scalability\n\n      Aspose.GIS performs great both on a server or client. It is designed to handle files of arbitrary size and complexity.\n      Deployment is as easy as copying a file. You do not have to worry about any other services or modules.\n\n      Visit our free support forum for Aspose.GIS for .NET: https://forum.aspose.com/c/gis",
