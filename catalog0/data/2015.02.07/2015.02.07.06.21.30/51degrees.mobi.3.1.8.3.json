  "releaseNotes": "Important: Upgrading users of Enhanced Data need version 3.1 format data.\nDevice detection algorithm is over 100 times faster than version 2. Regular expressions and levenshtein distance calculations are no longer used.\nThe device detection algorithm performance is no longer limited by the number of device combinations contained in the dataset.\nTwo modes of operation are available:\n  Memory – the detection data set is loaded into memory and there is no continuous connection to the source data file. Slower initialisation time but faster detection performance.\n  Stream – relevant parts of the data set are loaded into memory when required and cached to improve performance. Rapid initialisation time but approximately 50% slower detection performance. This mode is used when operated in a web environment.\nJPG and PNG format images can be optimised to improve performance.\nBandwidth and response times can be monitored to understand in real time the end users experience.\nFeature detection is used to override properties in the data set to provide details such as iPhone model or the screen orientation. These values become available to the server from the 2nd request from the device onwards.\nMulti-threading is no longer used within the matching algorithm.\nWhen used in a web environment the detection results are stored within the session when available and are no longer cached separately.\n-- Changes between version 3.1.8.3 and 3.1.7.5 --\n1. When used with MVC or Ajax some fringe cases have been reported where the HttpContext did not exist. The structure of the WebProvider has been changed to only use an HttpRequest object and not use the HttpContext. Further it does not rely on the presence of an IDictionary to persist the results of device detection across the request if one can’t be found from the Request or the HttpContext.Current property.\n2. The Detection.Entities.Stream.Source class no longer directly logs if a temporary file cannot be deleted. Instead the exception is thrown up. This change was made for other assemblies using this code that did not reference Event.Log.\n3. Fixed a bug when dealing with null useragents introduced in 3.1.8.2.",
