Each 10-minute game puts you on a deserted island where you battle against 49 other players, all in search of survival.\n\nPlayers are free to choose their starting point with their parachute and aim to stay in the safe zone as long as possible. Drive vehicles to explore the vast map, hide in trenches, or become invisible by hiding under the grass. Ambush, shoot, defend, there is only one goal: survive and answer the call of duty. Do Want to get more Garena Free Fire diamonds? You've come to the right place. This precious currency allows you to buy a wide variety of cosmetics on offer, allowing you to show off your prowess (or how much you've spent) during the game. You can get fancy character outfits, individual clothing items, vehicles, weapons, and more. Some of them even glow. Good.\n\nWhile you can get weird Garena Free Fire diamonds for free, it's not easy, and the amount you get is often much lower than from other sources, such as buying it straight away. This is usually limited to events.
