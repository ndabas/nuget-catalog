  "releaseNotes": "7/10/2015 2.0.0\n\nRelease Notes: Azure Batch Service General Availability\n\nBackwards compatibility and support lifecycle of Public Preview assembly.\n    Please see the following blog post:\n        http://blogs.technet.com/b/windowshpc/archive/2015/07/10/what-39-s-new-in-azure-batch-july-release-general-availability.aspx\n\nArchitecture changes:\n    CloudJobSchedule added.                 Use this class to control job schedules.\n    CloudWorkitem removed.                  The features in this class were moved to other classes.\n    CloudJob promoted to top level entity.  This class got some features of the deprecated CloudWorkitem.\n\n    IMPORTANT:\n        You create a CloudJob directly now with the BatchClient.JobOperations.CreateJob() method.\n        It is no longer necessary to create a CloudWorkitem and wait on the RecentJob.\n\nOperations instead of Managers:\n    The interface IBatchClient has been removed (see interface section removal below) and replaced by the implementation class BatchClient.\n    The factories found on IBatchClient have been renamed or removed from the BatchClient class.\n    The BatchClient class now has the following properties:\n\n        CertificateOperations           (replaces IBatchClient.OpenCertificateManager())\n        JobOperations                   (includes methods formerly found on IBatchClient.OpenWorkItemManager())\n        JobScheduleOperations           (methods for use of the CloudJobSchedule class)\n        PoolOperations                  (replaces IBatchClient.OpenPoolManager()\n        Utilities                       (replaces IBatchClient.OpenToolbox())\n\nInterfaces removed:\n    Most of the C# Interfaces have been removed from the library.\n    In their place, the implementation classes have been made public.\n\n    Examples:\n        IBatchClient    removed and replaced by class BatchClient.\n        ICloudWorkItem  removed.\n        ICloudJob       removed and replaced by class CloudJob.\n        ICloudTask      removed.  Class CloudTask was always public.\n        ICloudPool      removed and replaced by class CloudPool\n        etc.\n\nMany implementations of IDisposable removed.\n    IDisposable is no longer on many classes.\n    Please note that class BatchClient still implements IDisposable.\n\nPublics renamed:\n    \"Managers\" have been renamed (see section above \"Operations instead of Managers\").\n    The VM class has been renamed to ComputeNode.\n    ITaskFile has been replaced by NodeFile.\n    BatchCredential has been renamed/replaced with BatchSharedKeyCredential.\n    BatchClient.Connect() has been renamed to BatchClient.OpenAsync() and/or BatchClient.Open().\n\n    \"Name\" to \"Id\":\n        The \"Name\" field has been renamed to \"Id\" in top level classes (CloudJob, CloudPool, CloudTask, etc).\n        In most cases an additional field \"DispalyName\" has been added.\n\n    PoolManager (now PoolOperations):\n        GetJobPreparationTaskStatusAsync was removed and replaced by JobOperations.ListJobPreparationAndReleaseTaskStatus().\n        GetJobReleaseTaskStatusAsync was removed and replaced by JobOperations.ListJobPreparationAndReleaseTaskStatus().\n\nIEnumerableAsyncExtended and Paged Collections:\n    IPagedEnumerable<T>/IPagedEnumerator<T> replace the IEnumerableAsyncExtended<T> feature set.\n    These interfaces expose asynchronous patterns for enumeration of collections that are backed by paging calls to the Batch Service.\n    IPagedEnumerable<T> also implements IEnumerable<T> so all common collection manipulations are supported.\n    Caution should be used with IEnumerable<T> since it is a synchronous calling pattern and results in \n    calls to the blocking synchronous wrapper of IPagedEnumerator<T>.MoveNextAsync().\n\n    IPagedEnumerable<T> exposes the following new asynchronous methods:\n\n        Task ForEachAsync<T>()\n        Task<List<T>> ToListAsync<T>()\n\n        These methods can assist the transition to asynchronous programming patterns with paged collections.\n\nREST Proxy Level\n\n    The REST proxies from Public Preview have been replaced by the Protocol.BatchRestClient class and associated namespaces.\n    Azure services are adopting generated proxies to enable multiple languages and platforms.\n    The methods and classes found in the Protocol.BatchRestClient are complete over Batch Service REST API.\n    The BatchClient class constructs an instance of Protocol.BatchRestClient internally.\n    There is an override of BatchClient.OpenAsync()/Open() that allows the caller to provide their own instance of Protocol.BatchRestClient.\n\n    Features found in BatchClient and Protocol.BatchRestClient can be used independently or simultaneously.\n    However, it is important to know that BatchClient classes and features are not automatically aware of the effects of\n    calls made via Protocol.BatchRestClient.\n\n    If a mixed programming model is needed, use the BatchClientBehavior and Interceptor Model.\n\nBatchClientBehavior and Interceptor Model:\n\n    Some behaviors have been renamed (SetRetryPolicy is now RetryPolicyProvider) and some have removed (OperationContextFactory).\n    The YieldInjectionInterceptor has been removed (use BatchRequest<T1,T2>.ServiceRequestFunc).\n\n    Interfaces and signatures of the interceptors have been changed to align with the new BatchRequest<T1,T2>.",
