Otherwise returns null.\nAspose.Slides.IShapeCollection.AddGroupShape() method had been added\n\nThe method Aspose.Slides.IShapeCollection.AddGroupShape() creates a new GroupShape and adds it to the end of the collection.\nGroupShape frame size and position will be fitted to content when new shape will be added into the GroupShape.\nAspose.Slides.IShapeCollection.Clear() method had been added\n\nThe method Aspose.Slides.IShapeCollection.Clear() removes all shapes from the collection.\nAspose.Slides.IShapeCollection.InsertGroupShape(int) method had been added\n\nThe method Aspose.Slides.IShapeCollection.InsertGroupShape(int) creates a new GroupShape and inserts it to the collection at the specified index.\nGroupShape frame size and position will be fitted to content when new shape will be added into the GroupShape.\nMethods IPresentationFactory.GetPresentationInfo(string file), IPresentatoinFactory.GetPresentationInfo(Stream stream) have been added\n\nThese methods allow to receive information about a presentaiton file/stream without full presentation loading.\nProperty IPresentationFactory PresentationFactory.Instance has been added\n\nAllows using the factory functionality without instantiation.\nRestrictions had been added for using undefined values for IShape.Frame\n\nCode that attempts to assign undefined frame to IShape.Frame doesn't make sence in general case (particulary in case when parent GroupShape is multiple nested into other GroupShape-s). For example:\nIShape shape = ...; shape.Frame = new ShapeFrame(float.NaN, float.NaN, float.NaN, float.NaN, NullableBool.NotDefined, NullableBool.NotDefined, float.NaN); or\n\nslide.Shapes.AddAutoShape(ShapeType.RoundCornerRectangle, float.NaN, float.NaN, float.NaN, float.NaN);\n\nSuch code can lead to unclear situations. So restrictions had been added for using undefined values for IShape.Frame. Values of x, y, width, height, flipH, flipV and rotationAngle must be defined (not float.NaN or NullableBool.NotDefined). Example code above now throws ArgumentException exception.\nThis applies to these use cases:\n\nIShape shape = ...;\nshape.Frame = ...; // cannot be undefined\n\nIShapeCollection shapes = ...;\n// x, y, width, height parameters cannot be float.NaN:\n{\n    shapes.AddAudioFrameCD(...);\n    shapes.AddAudioFrameEmbedded(...);\n    shapes.AddAudioFrameLinked(...);\n    shapes.AddAutoShape(...);\n    shapes.AddChart(...);\n    shapes.AddConnector(...);\n    shapes.AddOleObjectFrame(...);\n    shapes.AddPictureFrame(...);\n    shapes.AddSmartArt(...);\n    shapes.AddTable(...);\n    shapes.AddVideoFrame(...);\n    shapes.InsertAudioFrameEmbedded(...);\n    shapes.InsertAudioFrameLinked(...);\n    shapes.InsertAutoShape(...);\n    shapes.InsertChart(...);\n    shapes.InsertConnector(...);\n    shapes.InsertOleObjectFrame(...);\n    shapes.InsertPictureFrame(...);\n    shapes.InsertTable(...);\n    shapes.InsertVideoFrame(...);\n}\n\nBut IShape.RawFrame frame properties can be undefined. This make sence when shape is linked to placeholder. Then undefined shape frame values is overridden from the parent placeholder shape. If there is no parent placeholder shape for that shape then that shape uses default values when it evaluates effective frame based on its IShape.RawFrame. Default values are 0 and NullableBool.False for x, y, width, height, flipH, flipV and rotationAngle. For example:\n\nIShape shape = ...; // shape is linked to placeholder\nshape.RawFrame = new ShapeFrame(float.NaN, float.NaN, 100, float.NaN, NullableBool.NotDefined, NullableBool.NotDefined, 0);\n// now shape inherits x, y, height, flipH, flipV values form placeholder and overrides width=100 and rotationAngle=0.\n\nType and name of the Aspose.Slides.IShapeCollection.Parent property has been changed\n\nType of the Aspose.Slides.IShapeCollection.Parent property has been changed from ISlideComponent to new IGroupShape interface. IGroupShape interface is the descendant of the ISlideComponent so user code needs no adaptations.\nName of the Aspose.Slides.IShapeCollection.Parent property has been changed from Parent to ParentGroup.\nType of the Aspose.Slides.IShapeFrame.FlipH, .FlipV properties has been changed\n\nType of the Aspose.Slides.IShapeFrame.FlipH property has been changed from bool to NullableBool.\nIShape.Frame property return effective instace of IShapeFrame (all of which properties have defined effective values).\nIShape.RawFrame property return IShapeFrame instace of which each property can have undefined value (particularly FlipH or FlipV can have value NullableBool.NotDefined)",
