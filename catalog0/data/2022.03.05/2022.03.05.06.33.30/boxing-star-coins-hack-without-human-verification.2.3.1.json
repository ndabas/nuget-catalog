  "description": "boxing star coins hack without human verification\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰   https://getfreegem.com/BoxingStar/\n\nAfter you have done this, you will then need to plant your chosen star. Wait for the Mafia Wars mob to appear and then attack it. Don't worry if there are more than one of them - they will only do as much damage as one attack would. After you've done that, wait for two minutes, then plant your star.\n\nAfter doing that, you will need to rest. Resting here will rejuvenate your money, XP, and money in general, and helps you get through fights easier. Just don't stay in the fight too long, or you'll be out of money pretty quick. Pay close attention to what you're doing when not fighting, and you should be fine. If you do need to rest, run to the Auction Hall, pick up some food, and rest here for a while - the XP and money you'll get from resting will help you through fights.\n\nThis is a very simple method of getting lots of free gold in the Mafia Wars. It doesn't take too much time, and it doesn't cost anything. You just need to know where to find it.\n\nThe boxing star-free gold hack is a great method of quickly making lots of money in Mafia Wars. It's easy and free, so you should definitely use it. Just make sure you always use a clean computer before you start using it.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰   https://getfreegem.com/BoxingStar/\n\nBoxing star 2022,\nBoxing star gold hack,\nBoxing Star Free Gold account,\nBoxing star new hack,\nboxing star gold working tool,\nBoxing Star Free Gold,\nBoxing star hack,\nBoxing star hack new method,\nBoxing star gold generator tool,\n",
