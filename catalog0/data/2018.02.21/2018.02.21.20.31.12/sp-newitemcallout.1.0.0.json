  "description": "SharePoint custom callout for new item hero button\n\nThe main idea of this project was very simple. Look at this standard callout in SharePoint 2013 for a document library with enabled WOPI.\n\nMain feature of the solucion are:\n * The user can see the hero button only if the user has permissions in current folder \n * You can set the dependencies of content types for creation in settings javascript file\n * There is an option to show or use standard link if the content type to create is only one\n * There is an option to show a loading gif on the page instead of grid with data before callout data is loaded\n * There is an option that automatically reloads the page if the set of available content types updates. This option fixes the problem with available buttons in ribbon \n * There is an option that updates current folders available content types by the *ContentTypes* param in options\n * The solution shows the extended buttons for creating office documents on document libraries if office web apps is available\n * The solution works in SharePoint Foundation 2013, SharePoint Server 2013, SharePoint Online, SharePoint Server 2016\n * The solution has a localization for different languages. By default there is ru-ru localization and en-us (witch is by default)\n * The solution can work with enabled minimal download strategy feature\n * The solution is easy to configure and use\n-----\nThe project and details on github - https://github.com/sergeisnitko/spf-newitemcallout",
