  "releaseNotes": "Aspose.Imaging for .Net has been updated to version 2.2.0 and we are pleased to announce this release brings the addition of 22 new useful improvements. A very demanded feature for tiff data recovery has been implemented in this release.\n      The following is a list of changes in this version of Aspose.Imaging.\n\n      Major Features\n      Data recovery for Tiff\n      Starting from v2.2 Aspose.Imaging supports data recovery mode for tiff file format (IMAGING-33851). The data recovery allows to load any tiff file which has improper data layout or some data corruption exist. The corrupted data is replaced with some background defined and you will be able to retrieve the rest data and view its contents. This is especially useful for tiff file format since it stores the data in strips and when some strip is damaged the other strips may still retain the correct information and data recovery mode allows loading and viewing the rest strips data. To assist our customers we have also provided support for 2 data recovery modes: ConsistentRecover and MaximalRecover which may provide different results depending on the customer needs for data recovery.\n\n      Minor Features\n      New Features\n      (IMAGING-33470)\tDithering support\n      (IMAGING-33796)\t[Dxf to Pdf] Export of only specified layers\n      (IMAGING-33536)\tSupport CompactPalette property for the IColorPalette interface\n      (IMAGING-27111)\tJpeg file format support\n      Enhancements\n      (IMAGING-33908)\tRemove offline documentation and leave only ApiReference in chm\n      (IMAGING-33894)\tAdd online EULA button\n      Bugs\n      (IMAGING-33938)\tImage Saving Failed: while merging Tiff images\n      (IMAGING-33944)\tFail to save gif after load\n      (IMAGING-33907)\tGif image lost transparent color value after saving\n      (IMAGING-33895)\tInvestigate and fix special aligned dimension rendering\n      (IMAGING-33867)\t[Dxf to Pdf] Support for metric units rendering for all dimensions\n      (IMAGING-33849)\tInfinite execution on openning gif-image\n      (IMAGING-33843)\tIncorrect file format on Image.GetFileFormat\n      (IMAGING-33830)\tTiff created with Aspose.Imaging does not render properly in IrfanView and ACDsee\n      (IMAGING-33882)\t[Cad to Pdf] Fix bug with ellipses with start and end angles.\n      (IMAGING-33825)\t[Dxf to Pdf] Fix problem with closed polylines\n      (IMAGING-33820)\tAn empty png image is generated when resized\n      (IMAGING-33816)\t[Dxf to Pdf] Implement support of different linetypes for existing entities.\n      (IMAGING-33811)\tDxf to Pdf] Fix missed labels on dimension objects.\n      (IMAGING-33437)\tCustomer wants to convert 32bpp TIF sources to CCITT4 1bpp grayscale TIF\n      Exceptions\n      (IMAGING-33829)\tImageSaveException: The stream reader has passed over the data boundary.
