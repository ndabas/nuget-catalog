  "description": "[Promo code cheat] PUBG New State Free car skin and unlimited NC Generator Hacks 2021-22.\nIn order to get the best defensive practice in PUBG New State mod, be sure to isolate your house of life (because this is the main goal pursued by other players) and establish your defense near it. Keep your essence, rainbow essence and golden dust storage as close to your life hall as possible and your defense, because this is also the game player's goal, when you upgrade, isolate resource collector and defense. If you leave something less important outside the wall, the enemy will tend to aim at it and will be strafed by the fortifications inside the wall. Want a ton of free crystal? Remove any debris from your territory, such as fossils and toadstools, to get a free gem. Focus on completing tasks and achievements, as they will win you free crystals. Even if you don't plan to play, come back and check it every day, because if you play for 30 consecutive days, you will get a huge crystal bonus. Spend your money on buying a new fairy's nest so that you can build your city faster and longer.\npubg new state free car skin PUBG New State hacks android PUBG New State hacks nc PUBG New State hacks ios PUBG New State hack 2022 PUBG New State hack unlimited health download PUBG New State free nc PUBG New State free skins PUBG New State free nc hack PUBG New State free nc redeem code PUBG New State free skins link 2021 PUBG New State cheats pubg new state promo code pubg new state coupon code 2022\n\nðŸ‘‰ https://watermod.icu/pubg-new-state/",
