It's generally easy and fun to play. You don't have to invest lots of time in understanding how to play them. Here are the instructions on how best to play some mini-games in HAGO that I like best. The gamer will command the sheep to repel the enemy attacks. The larger sheep will undoubtedly be stronger and will break the rules small sheep, bringing them back to their homes. Whenever a sheep moves to the opponent's house, it may cause the opponent to get rid of a certain number of points. The smaller the sheep is, the more the point consumption will be.
