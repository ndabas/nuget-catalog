In fact the developers were even facing a legal suit against it. Players who have been playing the game before 2016 might be aware of another currency that existed in the game back then Tix. If you are wondering what it is here is all you need to know about it.\nCharge for skill passes in our games– Going back to creating our own game within Pixel Gun 3D Online Shooter we can elevate the experience an additional notch by designing special abilities characters and more that are only available if visiting players pay a certain price.
