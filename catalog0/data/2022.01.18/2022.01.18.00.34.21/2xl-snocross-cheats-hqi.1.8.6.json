The official 2XL Snocross site strongly advises against using schemes like account generators. They say that anyone asking you to input your details anywhere is scamming you and that you won’t receive a glitched account or 2XL Snocross. The terms of service also warn against it too. They say that you cannot obtain “exploited game or experience content.” This includes hacked accounts with Generator. If you’re caught doing this they reserve the right to immediately close your account.\nRedeeming a gift card on your account will store credit in your account which you can save for later use. Redeeming gift cards is only possible with a web browser meaning that you can't do it through the app or the game itself.\nGenerator can be purchased directly from 2XL Snocross in three tiers similar to the three tiers of a subscription to 2XL Snocross Premium. These are single-time payments though and can be a better option for those who don't want to commit to a recurring fee.\nThe recent update in 2XL Snocross Wacky Wizards introduced gems as a new currency. Similar to Generator gems can be used for purchasing premium ingredients and cauldron skins in the game. Apart from purchasing gems with real money players can also use a free alternative to acquire gems.\n2XL Snocross NO HUMAN VERIFICATION 2XL Snocross FOR KIDS 2020\n2XL Snocross GENERATOR NO HUMAN VERIFICATION 2XL Snocross VAN\n",
