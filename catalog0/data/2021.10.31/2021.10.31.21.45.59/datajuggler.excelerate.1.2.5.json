  "description": "Excelerate uses EPPPlus version 4.5.3.3 (last free version), and it makes it easy to load Workbooks or Worksheets. Excelerate now has a code generation feature, you can create a C# class from a header row.\n\nI have a couple of clients that I build programs that automate combining columns from multiple Worksheets to form reports.\n\nRather than continue to write custom loaders, I really only need custom Exporters in most cases, so I created this project.",

  "releaseNotes": "10.31.2021: (Take Six)\nVersion 1.2.5: I fixed Active being a boolean, and discovered the LoadMethod was trying to set bool columns to a string value.\n\n10.31.2021: (Take Five)\nVersion 1.2.4: I fixed the Active field = boolean. I need an else so the data type didn't get set to Int further in the AttemptToDetermineDataType method.\n\n10.31.2021: (Take Four)\nVersion 1.2.3: Added a check for data type boolean. To make this work, convert Excel bool values to True False vs 0 and 1.\n\n10.31.2021 (Take Three)\nVersion 1.2.2: Code generation is fixed with a reference to System is needed since Guid RowId has been added.\n\n10.31.2021 (Take Two)\nVersion 1.2.1: I messed up the code generation in Version 1.2.0 because the RowId field wasn't getting a field name written. Should work now.\n\n10.31.2021: \nVersion 1.2.0: The code generation of the RowId seems to work, so the 1.2 version starts the Saving features.\n\n10.31.2021\nVersion 1.1.10: I added RowNumber and Id (Guid) to class Row to help in saving, which I am just starting.\n\n10.16.2021\nVersion 1.1.9: I added a new method LoadAllData, which returns a DataJuggler.Excelerate.Workbook, which contains all DataJuggler.Excelerate.Worksheets, which contain all DataJuggler.Excelerate.Rows of data.\n\n10.16.2021:\nVersion 1.1.8: AppendPartialGuid is now an optional parameter, and only if true will the partial guid be appended to the filename.\n\n\n10.14.2021: \nVersion 1.1.7: CodeGenerator.GenerateClassFromWorksheet now returns an object of type CodeGenerationResponse. Previous version only returns a boolean, which wasn't very helpful for the caller.\n\n10.13.2021: New override for GetSheetNames takes a path argument.\nI am working on a new Blazor project called Blazor.Excelerate to demo this project.\n\n9.21.2021\nVersion 1.1.5:\nI created an ExcelHelper class because I needed the GetColumnLetter feature of ExcelCellAddress.\n\n9.20.2021\nVersion 1.1.4:\nI updated ExcelDataLoader to havea  LoadPackage method.\n\n9.20.2021:\nVersion 1.1.3:\nI added an OriginalFileName property to class Column, so the exported column header can be the same as the original.\n\n9.17.2021\nVersion 1.1.2:\nThe Code Generator class is now finished, and a Load method has been updated to test for\na null row or null row.Columns just to be safer.\n\nMore updates may come in the future, but for now I have completed what I started this project for.\nFor the amount of effort I put into this, I think the return on investment is quite satisfactory as\nnow I can build Excel projects much faster. \n\n9.17.2021\nVersion 1.1.1: I now code generate a Load method with the Code Generator, so a Row can be used to load an instance of the class created. This is still being tested.\n\n9.15.2021\nVersion 1.0.3: I added a LoadWorksheet override, so clients do not have to load a Workbook to get\nto a single worksheet.\n\nThis is the first release. I have just begun adding classes and helper methods to this. It does work for now to load a worksheet and all the Rows / Columns. Each column is loaded as an object ColumnValue, than properties exist that cast the ColumnValue as a bool, datetime, Decimal or other types.",
