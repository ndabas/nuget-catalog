  "description": "This library implements an in-process database for storing and retrieving class objects and their property values. The library is designed to be as easy to use as possible with a small public API. The backing storage is Azure Table Storage, so Azure account credentials are requried to use the library. This library is an experimental but compatible and fully working sibling of the Orthogonal.ObjectDb.Esent library which uses an in-process high-performance ESENT database as the backing storage. The ESENT backed database should be used where high-performance is required.",
