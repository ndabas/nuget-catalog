  "description": "This is the C# port built directly from source in the latest ZXing library release on Google Code. All credit for this library goes to the contributors of the ZXing project. Via SVN, this port was submitted by Suraj Supekar.  Seek support at the project site or the discussion group https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/zxing. \n\nZXing (pronounced \"zebra crossing\") is an open-source, multi-format 1D/2D barcode image processing library implemented in Java, with ports to other languages. Our focus is on using the built-in camera on mobile phones to scan and decode barcodes on the device, without communicating with a server. However the project can be used to encode and decode barcodes on desktops and servers as well.",
