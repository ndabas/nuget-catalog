  "description": "Store nearly anything instantly and easily, without the need of a database server. All you need to access to the folder where the data is stored. This is great for tiny applications, or giant enterprise applications because it scales from a single machine almost to infinity, with almost no degradation in performance from the first record to the trillionth. You can have as many nodes as can share a file (almost limitless), as many records as disk can hold (this grows every year), as much Sharding of data as folder structures allow (again, almost limitless). From a scaling perspective, it is very robust. The very granular, performant approach used removes almost all limits to size, accessibility and availability. The limits are controlled by the infrastructure and not by ZarahDB. If the OS can reach the file, ZarahDB can work with it.\n\nOpenSource code at https://github.com/MikeReedKS/ZarahDB",
