  "description": "This library implements an in-process database for storing and retrieving class objects and their property values. The library is designed to be as easy to use as possible, with a small footprint and trivial dependencies. The backing storage is the Microsoft Extensible Storage Engine (ESENT) high-performance, high-capacity, transactional database which is built into all modern versions of Windows. The ObjectDb runtime is implemented as two small managed libraries which are added as project references.",

  "releaseNotes": "BREAKING CHANGE -- Silent truncation of data stored in 'short' columns is no longer allowed and an InvalidOperationException is thrown if data loss would occur when inserting or updating a row (Issue #20). This new default behaviour can be bypassed by setting the library's ThrowOnTruncate property to False, in which case the historical behaviour is restored which allows data to be silently truncated. This change is unfortunately required to prevent accidental data loss, which would be highly undesirable in quality applications. The API has not otherwise changed.",
