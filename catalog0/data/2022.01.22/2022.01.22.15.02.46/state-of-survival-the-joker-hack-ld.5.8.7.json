Almost every game will have something you can buy with Generator and they do a great job of highlighting these within games making it very easy to spend spend spend. We’ll discuss how to get Generator later on but keep in mind that if your kid is playing State of Survival The Joker they will almost definitely start asking you to buy them Generator from the offset.\nBuying Generator with real-world money is the most convenient option for most players. The options are relatively cheap and pre-loaded cards are available at just about every grocery store in the Gift Card section.\nIt gets better because the membership program also offers you access to the game’s economic features. These include an increased revenue share on your State of Survival The Joker games (for developers) as well as options for buying selling  trading collectible items.\n",
