  "description": "Psn gift card codes that haven't been used:\n\n\nAny unused Playstation Card is found and activated even prior to the legimate owner get to utilize it by himself PSN account.Well we obviously considered this since the beginning, nonetheless it woudn't be very legal in the original place... Also, it would have been a little difficult since we didn't have in just about any manner to promote them, obviously we sold several to our own friends and friends of their friends for inexpensive, but this didn't get very far as we finished up running out of interested people.\n\n\nCHECK HERE >>>>>https://lootcodes.com/gift-psn\n\n \nWe seriously considered approaching teenagers in the road, and providing them to buy our cheap Playstation Network Card but considering we're finding a bit old, and that we aren't the most social beast on the market, it would looked somewhat weird and we obviously don't desire to draw attention on ourselves...Next, we started looking to promote directly on the web, and it had been far to be so easy, we already knew that but we kept trying, we got scammed several times for many incredible levels of money, and not just that, we also got our times stolen by those scammers since it took us quite a while to position this technique of obtaining free playstation codes and free ps plus codes.\n \nAfter so much pain trying to resell all those ps plus codes and PSN Card that we found, we finished up asking ourselves a questions. Why are we trying to resell them? We don't need the total amount of money, actually we don't care at all. So what's the offer? Shall we only hand out free PSN codes? What the heck you will want to things considered!We were sure some individuals would enjoy some free PS4 codes! We did not buy those either so let's give back again to those that needs it!\nWell we haven't really considered that. All things considered obviously the legimate.",
