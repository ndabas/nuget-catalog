To ensure that your kids can’t get scammed I recommend keeping their Poker With Bob password a secret from them so that they can never accidentally give it away.\nAlthough it’s free to start up remember that Poker With Bob is ultimately a business and so are many of the games on the platform. Many of the games promote game-changing boosts that can be purchased with a dedicated currency called Generator. Generator are purchased with real-world money and can be used to buy boosts within games and items for your avatar to name just two applications.\nIt should be noted that a majority of sites offering Generator for free are not legit. Most of the servers are filled with users spamming this site link which is likely not real users at all.However when players try to go to the blox.surf website the get redirected to blox.land website. This website is a survey website and after completing a survey players will get some Generator into their account. Users have reported that they have successfully got Generator after going through the withdrawal process without getting their accounts promised.\nTo get Gems for free you’ll need to beat the Mr. Rich hourly boss. This boss spawns in the area where your cauldron is and you and all the other players in your game will then be tasked with dealing damage to him with various potions.\nWith Ibotta you have yet another reliable online reward service you can use to save some more money. The Ibotta app pays you after you shop online and then upload a picture of your receipt.\n",
