  "releaseNotes": "Intended to work with Visual Studio 2010 or higher. Debugging a assembly with indexed PDB, AND \"Enable Source Server support\" option enabled will give Visual Studio the ability to download missing source code from version control server.\n\nThis version should be able to work while with repositories which origin remote is a GitHub (github.com or on-premise instalation) public repository.\n\nSource code must be at least staged for GitIndexer to index it.\n\n      \nNote: when you open Visual Studio without GitIndexer package on packages folders, and build it without prior restoring packges, NuGet will try to restore packages. But in this case, even when packages are successfully restored, GitIndexer targets will not be included during building. For C# projects, it will be included on next build attempt. For VB.NET and F#, it will require you to restart Visual Studio.\n\nBecause of that, GitIndexer will include on your project file a test on BeforeBuild target that will check whether GitIndexer targets hava been included on build, and will throw en error otherwise, describing what you will have to do to get it working based on your project type.",
