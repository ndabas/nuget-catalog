  "description": "Tiny (500 lines) dependency injection library that will build your object graphs based on code configuration similar to Spring.Net's code configuration policy. Many traditional DI-containers are pretty big and solve too many problems. Containers may be easy to use, but they are complex and not everyone knows them well enough to bring that complexity into their projects. My aim is to keep things small and simple as long as possible and anyone can learn to know these few hundered lines of code.
