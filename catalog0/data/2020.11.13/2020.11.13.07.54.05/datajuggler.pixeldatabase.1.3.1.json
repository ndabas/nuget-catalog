  "description": "This project started off inside a Windows Forms project called Transparency Maker, which I have ported to a Blazor project that is live PixelDatabase.Net https://pixeldatabase.net.\n\nThis project has been tested while I built PixelDatabase.Net, but I am sure more updates may be needed.",

  "releaseNotes": "1.3.1: After I published 1.3.0 I realized System.Graphics.Common was updated from \n4.7 to 5.0, so I updated that library.\n\n1.3.0: This version was converted to .Net5. No other code changes were made at this time.\n\n1.2.2: I fixed the way the PixelQueryParser works, and in theory I made it better. \nI also added short cuts so you you can now type MinMaxDiff instead of MinMaxDifference - 6 less pixels, and much easier to spell. This applies to all the Differences: BlueGreenDiff, BlueRedDiff, GreenRedDiff, and MinMaxDiff.\n\n1.2.1: I removed .Net Standard 2.1, since the only purpose for .Net Standard was to allow .Net Framework and .Net Core to work together, but in 3.1 .Net Framework and .Net Core parted for good. If anyone needs it I can put it back.\n\nAlso I added two new features for Scatter and Normalize.\n\n1.2.0: I added a couple of new features and fixed some bugs with the callback delegates if they were null.\nNew methods: \nCreateSubImage - The PixelDatabase must be loaded, pass in the TopLeft point and the rectange size.\nSearchForSubImage - This method returns a SearchResult object with the TopLeft point.\nclass SearchResult - This class contains a Point and a Score. It has a confidence property, but I haven't coded it yet.\n      \nHere is a sample project you can use that takes a screen shot and you click the canvas (PictureBox) \ncontaining the image to create sub images.\nThere is also a Search Mode that demonstrates searching for an image in another image.\n\nhttps://github.com/DataJuggler/SubImageCreator\n\nCode is new, so use at your own risk. I have a sample project on GitHub to test this that takes a screen\nshot and you can click the picture of the screenshot to create sub images. All more of a test than anything\nuseful yet, but I might expand it over time.\n\n\n1.1.6: Added a new method CreateSubImage. Tested and it works, but not tested very thoroughly\n\n1.1.5: I added a new method ApplyPixel, which was added to the .Net Framework version so I can call this from a Paint.Net plug-in\n\n1.1.4: I had to update DataJuggler.UltimateHelper.Core.IsNumeric method to support negative numbers.\n\n1.1.3: I removed Absolute value from BlueRedDifference, BlueGreenDifference and GreenRedDifference.\nAfter working with these values for a few weeks, I discovered there is a difference between blue - red and red - blue, sometimes. \n\n1.1.2: I fixed a bug that has been bugging me for days. Now you apply a color:\nUpdate\nSet Color 98 125 86\n\nI had forgot to set the property SetColor to true.\n\n1.1.1: I have been working with PixelDatabase.Net website, so quite a few chagnes needed to be checked in.\n\n1.1.0: I discovered in my initial testing that the old way was using 7 gigs of memory to hold a list of \nmillions of PixelInformation objects. Now I do the BQL comparisons without instantiating tons of objects and\nthe memory foot print went down to under 300 meg for a Blazor website with a 20 meg image loaded.\n\n1.0.7: I am publishing the version that is going to be on my website https://pixeldatabase.net.\n\nThis version includes many new properties on a PixelInformation object, such as:\n1. Min\n2. Max\n3. Average\n4. MinMaxDiff\n5. RedMinDiff\n6. RedMaxDiff\n7. RedAverageDiff\n8. GreenMinDiff\n9. GreenMaxDiff\n10. GreenAverageDiff\n11. BlueMinDiff\n12. BlueMaxDiff\n13. BlueAverageDiff\n\nThese should all work for queries such as:\n\nHide Pixels Where\nMinMaxDiff > 25\n\nOr\n\nUpdate\nSet Swap Blue Red\nWhere\nRedMinDiff < 10\n\n\nDiff is a shortcut for Difference. Previous docs may use Difference, and I am trying \nto replace them as I see them.\n\n\n\n1.0.6: I have been working on this project for several weeks, and I need to update Nuget.\n\n1.0.5: I fixed a bug where Swap Colors was not taking the Alpha into account from the previous color.\n\n1.0.4: I made some changes while working on the .Net Framework version, and I am trying to keep them in sync. The changes involved I added a new draw line in color feature, a new feature for LastUpdate can always be queried by:\n\nUpdate\nblah blah blah\nWhere\nPixels In LastUpdate\n\nAlso some changes to the Draw Line, which is still very slow, but now a message shows.\nI need to create an abort for Draw Line, just haven't had a chance yet. I will work on this some more next week.\n\n1.0.3: I added a new override to PixelDatabaseLoder for ImageUrl.\n\n1.0.2: I had forgot to list the Project Url, as well as the description changed from untested, to lightly tested.\n\n1.0.1: Changed TargetFramework netcoreapp3.1 to TargetFrameworks netstandard2.1;netcoreapp3.1\n\nFirst release, i will update the rest of the info if it gets past proof of concept.",
