  "releaseNotes": "HiDPI Displays\nIn this version, we are glad to introduce the HiDPI Displays support which allows using all DPI-aware modes. The `BrowserView` control is compatible with different DPI awareness modes and renders HTML content with respect to the scale factor.\nSee https://dotnetbrowser.support.teamdev.com/solution/articles/9000149568-hidpi-displays for more details.\n\nFIPS-compliant\nWe are FIPS-compliant now! Starting from the version 1.16 it is possible to use DotNetBrowser in environments where the FIPS restriction is enabled.\n\nFixes:\n- The issue when the `KeyDown` event was unable to subscribe in WinForms in the lightweight rendering mode.\n- The issue when the `MouseMove`, `MouseEnter` and `MouseExit` events were not forwarded in WinForms in the heavyweight rendering mode.\n- The native crash on specific video cards and VMs.\n- The issue when a webpage content was rendered with wrong height and width in the lightweight rendering mode.\n\nImprovements:\n- The render channel initialization has been improved by preventing script context creation until the client-side Browser instance is created.\n- The Printing API has been extended with the ability to get the type of the printed document (PDF or HTML).\n- The ability to set `BrowserPreferences.CrashDumpDir` as an empty string in case if customers don't want to store crash dumps.",
