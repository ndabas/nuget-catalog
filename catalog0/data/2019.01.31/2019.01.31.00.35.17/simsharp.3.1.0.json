  "description": "Sim# aims to port the concepts used in SimPy (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/simpy) to the .NET world. It is implemented in C# and builds on the .NET Framework 4.5 / .NET Standard 2.0. Sim# uses an efficient event queue (adapted from https://github.com/BlueRaja/High-Speed-Priority-Queue-for-C-Sharp). The MachineShop benchmark comes close to 4 million events per second on a Core i7-7 2.7Ghz.\n\nSimPy allows modeling processes easily and with little boiler plate code. A process is described as a method that yields events. When an event is yielded, the process waits on it. Processes are themselves events and so it is convenient to spawn sub-processes that can either be waited upon or that run next to each other. There is no need to inherit from classes or understand a complex object oriented design.",

  "releaseNotes": "3.1.0\n - Introduce a faster non-thread safe Simulation class (Environment is now obsolete - backwards compatibility should be preserved)\n - Introduce When* events for resources allowing to observe changes without having to fall back to using tiny intervals\n - Introduce PriorityStore that can be used whenever a simple priority queue should be modeled\n - Introduce permuted congruential generator (PCG) as default random number generator in Simulation (Environment will still default to System.Random as before)\n - Change method to generate normal distributed random values to Marsaglia-polar method (Environment still uses the old method)\n - Introduce additional API methods to provide a separate RNG instance\n - Introduce additional API for generating log-normal distributed values (by giving desired mean and stdev)\n - Remove warnings by changing \"Process\" property of events to \"Owner\" also enabling to set it (when ownership changes, e.g. as the request is handed to a different process)\n - PreemptiveResource now uses the same priority handling as SimPy (breaks backwards compatibility - results may change)\n - Remove net40 target (simplifies the build)\n - Fix GasStationRefueling sample\n\n3.0.11\n - Fixed bug that would cause an infinite loop in ResourcePool when requesting unavailable objects\n \n 3.0.10\n - Added target for .NET Standard 2.0 in addition to .NET Framework 4 and .NET Framework 4.5\n - Fixed bug that would allow a process to continue if it yielded a failed process that has already been processed\n\n3.0.9\n- Fixed bug that would not dispose of resource requests if they are released before they are processed",
