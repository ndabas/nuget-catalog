That makes them a very convenient gift to give and receive at the holidays.\n\nBut their wide availability also comes with some dangers, with gift card scams becoming more common. While acquiring gift cards at valid locations and sites is safe (since cards are activated upon checkout), you should always avoid websites that advertise as a \"gift code generator\" or anything like it.
