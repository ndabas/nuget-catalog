  "description": "The goal of AtomicMVVM is to allow developers to work with MVVM in their XAML based solutions (XPF, Silverlight, Windows Phone, WinRT) with minimal effort while not getting in the way of the code. It requires .NET 4 or higher. The design goals of AtomicMVVM are (in order): simple over feature rich, unobtrusive over less code and convention over configuration.",

  "releaseNotes": "NOTE: This version has breaking changes from v3.\nThe bootstrapper is no longer generic, rather the generic aspects have been moved to the Start method.\n  This enables the bootstrapper to be used more easily (internally & externally).\n  This also enables future ideas such as switching out the shell.\nPreviously internal fields for current shell, view & view model are now public properties.\n  This enables the bootstrapper to be better unit tested itself & used in unit testing.\n  Allows for some dynamic logic in view models.\nCoreData now has a bootstrapper property\n  When a view model is created the property is set to the creating bootstrapper allowing for the view model to be able to interact with the bootstrapper without needing global variables etc...\n  This was really only enabled with the removal of the generic aspects (above).\nAdded the StubShell\n  This is a simple shell implementation for use in unit tests.\nUpdated all the Metro aspects to work with Windows 8 Release Candidate\n  This was really just two things, removing an unused namespace & changing to the new async invoker.",
