  "description": "EVO HTML to PDF Converter for Azure was developed for Azure Websites which have to run under a restricted environment. The general library for .NET can still be used directly in web roles and worker roles of Azure Cloud Services and in applications running on Azure Virtual Machines but it cannot be used in Azure Websites directly because of the restrictions imposed by Azure App Services environment.\n\nWhile the EVO HTML to PDF Converter Library for .NET does not depend on any external services or programs, the solution for Azure Websites requires the installation of a HTML to PDF server which was built on the library for .NET. The HTML to PDF server can run in a Windows Service or in an Azure Cloud Service. The client library you link in your application can talk to HTML to PDF Server completely transparent for you offering an API and a functionality similar to the library for .NET.\n\nThe converter offers full support for HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, SVG, web fonts, page breaks control with CSS and from API, automatically repeated HTML table header and footer, live URLs and internal links, automatically generated hierarchical bookmarks and table of contents, automatically generated fillable PDF forms and allows you to digitally sign and password protect the generated PDF documents.",
