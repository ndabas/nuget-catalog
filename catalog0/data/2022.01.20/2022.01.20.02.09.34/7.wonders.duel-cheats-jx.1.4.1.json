Dave Carr of the Decentraland Foundation tells me that the founders decided that “rather than have these environments be controlled by central bodies they should have a decentralised structure and be open to everyone to own and govern.” From economic matters to content moderation and even the maintenance of its servers Decentraland’s user base dictates its entire policy course through regular votes.\nYou can repeatedly kill Mr. Rich each hour and take the Cyclops Eye to the wizard to keep earning 20 Gems for free. In other words there’s no limit to the number of free Gems you can get.\nRecently a number of rumors have surfaced which have been suggesting that Tix is probably making its way back into the game.
