  "description": "Provide an easy way of mapping objects to SQL Server database table by using Attributes. If you want to query a database table but do not want to write complex and complicated SQL query, you can use this package. By just specifying some metadata on class and its property using attributes, you can start querying the table in no time. \n\nImportant Note: The main class for this package, EntityTable, implements IEnumerable interface, so you can easily use Linq to query the entities in the EntityTable as the entities are mapped to the records in the database table.",

  "releaseNotes": "In this second major release (v.3.0.0) of KininTech.SqlMapping, there are a lot of significant additions and changes made to the package. \n\nv.3.0.0 changes:\n\nMajor Announcement from the Author: I would like to apologize for the package's inconvenient and ambiguous checkings that caused improbable exceptions during model validation. Especially, the nullable types between SQL Server and .NET Framework were not handled correctly. Moreover, the introduction of Key class has made the usage of the EntityTable class more complex. Having taken these factors into consideration, I decided to make the following changes:\n\n- The Key class and the associated methods GetByKey(), Contains(), Delete() have been removed.\n- The EntityTable class can now checks a nullable property correctly regardless of it being a generic, Nullable, type.\n- The EntityTable class can now checks and retrieves the correct nullable value for the correct types in each Sql operation.\n- Some unneccessary codes have been removed; some similar codes have been merged, so there is slight increase in the performance.\n\nThe next major release v.4.0.0 will be launched anytime between mid- and late- August, 2020. However, until then, the minor release of v3.0.0 will still be going on, so you will receieve one or two minor releases of v.2.0.0.",
