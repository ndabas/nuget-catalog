The movies is magical yet amazing. It shows one of the best bonds i have seen in a Disney/Pixar movie. It shows how these two brothers are able to accomplish anything that they set their mind to and are able to work together to complete this journey that they take to find their father. Though it may be an exciting and fun movie to watch its also very emotional. The hardship and rough spots that they had to go through was very touching. In the over all end i hope this pushes you to go Watch Onward. START YOUR CARS UP AND HEAD ONWARD TO THE MOVIE THEATERS TO SEE THIS PIXAR /DISNEY FILM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nThis film is a great film about a siblings coming together and finding how thankful they are to have each other. The film did well with its script with seed planting in the beginning for the climatic reveal. I would recommend this film to families and individuals. Pixar made another great emotional film. I thought Onward accomplished a better bond between siblings than Frozen had done. Overall it was entertaining, inspiring, joyful, and emotional.\n\n",
