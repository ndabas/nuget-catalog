We are searching for a\n            more convenient solution.\n            It seems it requires some changes on the server side.\n            FIX of the swiping issue (iOS, server version >= 1.5.0). Now the swiping is implemented differently by\n            AndroidDriver and IOSDriver.\n            the ability to start an activity using Android intent actions, intent categories, flags and arguments was\n            added to OpenQA.Selenium.Appium.Android.AndroidDriver.\n            The StartActivityWithIntent method.\n            [Android] ability to push a common string as a file to the remote mobile device.

It works against text\n            input elements on Android.\n\n            1.5.1.1\n            Update to Selenium.Webdriver v2.53.0 and Selenium.Support v2.53.0\n            Update to Newtonsoft.Json v8.0.2\n            FIXED The issue of compatibility of AppiumServiceBuilder with Appium node server v >= 1.5.x.\n            Page object tools were updated.

The LockDevice(seconds) is obsolete and it is going to be removed in the\n            next release. Since Appium node server v1.5.x it is recommended to use\n            AndroidDriver.Lock()()...AndroidDriver.Unlock() or IOSDriver.Lock(int seconds) instead.\n            AndroidDriver.KeyEvent() is obsolete and it is going to be removed soon. Please use\n            AndroidDriver.PressKeyCode or AndroidDriver.LongPressKeyCode instead.\n            The GetAppStrings(string language = null) method is obsolete now. It is going to be removed.\n            The GetAppStringDictionary(string language = null, string stringFile = null) was added instead. It returns a\n            dictionary with app strings (keys and values) instead of a string. Also it allows the searching app strings\n            in the specified file.\n            All capabilities were added according to\n            https://github.com/appium/appium/blob/1.5/docs/en/writing-running-appium/caps.md. There are three classes:\n            OpenQA.Selenium.Appium.Enums.MobileCapabilityType (just modified),\n            OpenQA.Selenium.Appium.Enums.AndroidMobileCapabilityType (android-specific capabilities),\n            OpenQA.Selenium.Appium.Enums.IOSMobileCapabilityType (iOS-specific capabilities).\n            Some server flags were marked as obsolete because they are deprecated since server node v1.5.x. These\n            options are going to be removed at the next .Net client release.\n            The ability to start Appium node programmatically using desired capabilities. This feature is compatible\n            with Appium node server v >= 1.5.x.\n\n            1.5.0.1\n            Update to Selenium.Webdriver v2.48.2 and Selenium.Support v2.48.2\n            The ability to start appium server programmatically was provided. The ICommandServer implementation\n            (AppiumLocalService).\n            The new boolean parameter of the AndroidDdriver.StartActivity method. It allows to start a new activity\n            without closing of a target app.\n            All possible key codes were added to AndroidKeyCode.\n            The API refactoring.\n            The \"ReplaceValue\" method was added to AndroidElement\n            The \"SetImmediateValue\" was moved from the AppiumWebElement to IOSElement\n\n            1.4.1.1\n            Update to Selenium.Webdriver v2.48.1 and Selenium.Support v2.48.1\n            .Net client is completely following the Apache 2.0 license now.\n            IMobileElement implementations are able to perform gestures such as Pinch, Tap and Zoom.\n            Constructor set of MultiAction and TouchAction was improved. Redundant constructors were removed.\n\n            1.4.0.3\n            the bug which prevented the using of TouchAction/MultiTouchActions with IWebElement was fixed. This problem\n            is reproduced\n            with IWebElement instances created via Selenium PageFactory.\n\n            1.4.0.2\n            features ported from the Java-Appium-Driver. Integration with Selenium PageFactory.\n\n            1.3.0.1\n            Generic AppiumDriver class/subclasses and fix for TryAddCommand.\n\n            1.2.0.8\n            Fix/Test for hide keyboard.\n\n            1.2.0.7\n            Separate android and ios drivers, improved namespaces, fixed tests, and redesigned methods and interfaces\n\n            1.2.0.6\n            Update Selenium NuGet Package to get fix for locator strategy.\n\n            1.2.0.5\n            Add GetSettings and IgnoreUnimportantViews methods.\n\n            1.2.0.4\n            Update version due to assembly not matching NuGet.\n\n            1.2.0.3\n            Update version due to NuGet Package mismanagement.\n\n            1.2.0.2\n            Update NuGet packages.
