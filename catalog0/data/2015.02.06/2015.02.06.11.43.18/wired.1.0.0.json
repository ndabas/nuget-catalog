  "releaseNotes": "WIRED 1.0.0\n \n- BW and VG modules are deprecated. We merged everything in a WD master module. We will keep venge-angular and betway-angular in our CDN for two more releases, so if you want to use them cache them immediately. We will not be responsible for breaking your projects if you are still pointing to our live CDN.\n \n- bw and vg prefixes in the directives changed to wd.\n \n- BUNS is not part of the WIRED framework anymore. We understand the importance of BUNS but  WIRED offers a very similar tab system that can fit any LBM sub-brand without being attached to betway.\n \n- Brand new services: wd$cookie, wd$account, wd$api, wd$currentUser, wd$favouriteGames, wd$gameSearch, wd$games, wd$loyalty, w$products, wd$promotions and wd$winners.\n \n- New filters: decimal and truncate.\n \n- New directives: wdCookieDisclaimer, wdJackpotTicker, wdNodsTest, wdOnload and wdTabset",
