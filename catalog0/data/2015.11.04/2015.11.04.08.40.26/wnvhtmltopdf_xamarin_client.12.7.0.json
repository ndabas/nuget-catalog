Winnovative HTML to PDF Converter Server can run either in a Windows Service on a Windows machine or in an Azure Cloud Service deployed in Microsoft Azure cloud. The client library that you link in your Xamarin applications will connect to the server to convert HTML to PDF, to Image or to SVG.\n\nThe converter offers full support for HTML tags, HTML5 with CSS3, SVG and Web Fonts, page breaks control, media type rules, repeating HTML table header and footer, hierarchical bookmarks, tables of contents, fillable PDF forms, HTML with page numbering in header and footer.",
