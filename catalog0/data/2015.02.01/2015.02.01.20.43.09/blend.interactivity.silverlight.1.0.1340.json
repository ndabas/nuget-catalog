  "summary": "Microsoft Expression Blend 4 includes new built-in behaviors, which are reusable pieces of packaged code that can be dragged onto any object, and then fine-tuned by changing their properties. Behaviors allow you to add interactivity to your applications without having to write any code. The Behavior API consists of three core classes: Trigger, Action and Behavior. This SDK explores how to write each of these components, and contains a few code samples to help you get started. Programming reference topics are provided for Microsoft Silverlight. For more how-to and overview information about behaviors in Expression Blend, see the Expression Blend User Guide, available when you install Expression Blend 4.",
