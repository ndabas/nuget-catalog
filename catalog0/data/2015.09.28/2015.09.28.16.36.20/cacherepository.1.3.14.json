  "releaseNotes": "[1.3.14] Added a new GetAll strategy that will not throw when trying to retrieve bad values from a DataReader.\n[1.3.13] Added the ability to supply delimited identifiers if you don't want to use Sql Server's square brackets.\n[1.3.12] Fixed bug with trying to dispose a null transaction/connection.\n[1.3.11] Pushed the new GetAll method down to the implementations.\n[1.3.10] Added the ability to get all entities not using a generic.\n[1.3.9] Really fixed the problem with trimming when an empty field delimitor is used. \n[1.3.8] Fixed an issue when the delimited file might not have all of the delimiters on a line. \n[1.3.7] Fixed a problem with trimming when the value to trim is an empty string.\n[1.3.6] Changed the .net target framework from 4.5 to 4.0. This will allow older projects to depend on this library.\n[1.3.5] Fixed a bug within the Repository that would try and get a max id value when an insert is called even if the IdDoesNotExist strategy was declared. This was also causing an unnecessary select * query when ids are guids. \n[1.3.4] Made the SqlWithPassThruConnectionAndTransactionConnectionResolver constructor public. Otherwise its' not useful.\n[1.3.3] Updated the nuspec\n[1.3.2] Created the SqlWithPassThruConnectionAndTransactionConnectionResolver as a way to use this library with an existing IDbConnection and IDbTransaction.\n[1.3.1] Updated FubuCore to 1.0.0.225 version.\n[1.3] Added the ability to insert lines into existing text files by either overwriting or appending.\n[1.2] Expanded the FileRepository's API to now allow you to insert lines into text files.\n[1.1] Made entity id configuration not necessary for most cases.\n[1.0] This is the initial release of the library.",
