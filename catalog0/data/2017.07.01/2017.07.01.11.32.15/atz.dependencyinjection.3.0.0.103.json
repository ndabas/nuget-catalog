  "releaseNotes": "3.0.0:\n- PCL 259.\n- Because Ninject caused me a lot of headache with its internal trickery around PCL, removed dependency on its interfaces. This also allows the library to be IoC system independent.\n      \n2.2.0:\n- Introducing ATZ.DependencyInjection.System.Windows.\n- Adding ATZ.DependencyInjection.System.Windows.IMessageBox\n      \n2.1.0:\n- Retaining JetBrains.Annotations symbols on the API.\n      \n2.0.1:\n- Fixing problem with installation of the ATZ.DependencyInjection.System module.\n      \n2.0.0:\n- For when trying to get contra-variant interface for a non-generic interface, now ArgumentOutOfRange exception is shown instead of ArgumentException.\n- Eliminating possibilities for null reference exceptions and adding annotations for ReSharper.\n\n1.3.4:\n- In some tricky cases the object activated through the Kernel could not be casted to the expected return type, but the underlying problem is a missing implementation in the client code. Now this condition is properly detected and also signalled with ActivationException. Previously this returned null, which caused NullReferenceException in the client code, while the compiler detected the code to be correct.\n      \n1.3.3:\n- Excluding unintentionally delivered DLLs from the NuGet package.\n\n1.3.2:\n- Fixing 4th version number to be the number of the build instead some time dependent number indicated by *, as in case of time dependency different target frameworks got different numbers.\n\n1.3.1:\n- Missing .NET 4.5 files corrected.\n      \n1.3.0:\n- Supporting .NET 4.5 target framework.\n      \n1.2.2:\n- Documented what happens when trying to get a contravariant interface from a non-generic interface parameter.\n      \n1.2.1:\n- As ATZ.Reflection.TypeExtensions introduced GenericTypeParameterCount in version 1.1 of the API the NuGet package should require at least that version, since it is using it.\n      \n1.2.0:\n- Added SystemDebug and IDebug, so TDD method can be used to verify that certain messages has been placed into the debug message stack.\n      \n1.1.1:\n- Fixing missing documentation of public API.\n- Fixed a bug that allowed the previous singleton instance of the Ninject kernel on reinitialization to stay in the memory, causing memory leaks.\n      \n1.1:\n- Added DependencyResolver.GetInterface(this IKernel, Type, Type) to support contravariant interface resolution without casting of the return type. This helps debug casting issues.\n\n1.0:\n- Initial NuGet Packaging.",
