  "description": "ActiveSharp works using a unique combination of runtime identification of fields that are passed \"by ref\", and runtime MSIL inspection (to see which properties use those fields). The MSIL inspection is done only once, then cached. The by-ref field lookup is done on every call, but it's very quick (basically just an integer subtraction and a hash table lookup).",
