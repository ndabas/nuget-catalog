  "description": "Eto.Forms is a cross platform desktop user interface framework.\n\nThis framework is built so that you can target multiple platforms with one UI codebase.\n\nThe goal of this framework is to expose a common API that can be used to build functional applications that run across platforms using their native toolkit. This will make your applications look and work as if it were a native application on all platforms.\n\nFor advanced scenarios, you can take advantage of each platform's capabilities by wrapping your common UI in a larger application, or even create your own high-level controls with a custom implementations per platform.\n\nThis framework currently supports creating Desktop applications that work across Windows Forms, WPF, MonoMac/Xamarin.Mac, and GTK#.\n\nIn order to run your Eto.Forms based application, you must also install one (or more) of the following packages:\n\n- Eto.Platform.Wpf\n- Eto.Platform.Windows\n- Eto.Platform.Direct2D\n- Eto.Platform.Gtk\n- Eto.Platform.Gtk3\n- Eto.Platform.Mac\n- Eto.Platform.XamMac  * requires Xamarin Studio on OS X.\n- Eto.Platform.XamMac2  * requires Xamarin Studio on OS X.\n\nTo get more information about how to get started, read the wiki:\n\nhttps://github.com/picoe/Eto/wiki",
