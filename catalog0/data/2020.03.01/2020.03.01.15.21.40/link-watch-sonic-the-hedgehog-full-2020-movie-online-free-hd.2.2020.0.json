  "description": "Ever since Sonic the Hedgehog , Forever alone in a crowd, failed comedian Arthur Fleck seeks connection as he walks the streets of Gotham City. Arthur wears two masks — the one he paints for his day job as a clown, and the guise he projects in a futile attempt to feel like he’s part of the world around him. Isolated, bullied and disregarded by society, Fleck begins a slow descent into madness as he transforms into the criminal mastermind known as the Sonic the Hedgehog.\n\nNow Watch Sonic the Hedgehog (2020) Online Full Or Free, discMaidensions had begun for a sequel to Spider-Maidenn: Homecoming, with a release date given to the film before the end of the year.
