  "description": "Have you ever seen an owl do a barrel roll? Me neither.\n\nEssential supplemental tooling for .NET development. Included in this package:\n- OwlCore.Storage: The fundamental concepts of files and folders carefully abstracted into standard interfaces. Interact with Local Disk, Cloud Storage, Blob Storage, protocol-based storage, and even 100% in-memory storage, all using the same interfaces.\n- OwlCore.Extensions: A collection of exceptionally useful extension methods.\n- OwlCore.ComponentModel: Provides classes used to implement the run-time behavior of components. SettingsBase, IDelegatable{T}, IAsyncInit, etc.\n- Much more not listed, much more to come.\n\nThe experimental, available in separate packages:\n- OwlCore.Remoting: A extremely lightweight and flexible RPC framework for .NET Standard 2.0.\n- OwlCore.Kubo: A library of essential tooling for Kubo, the earliest and most widely used implementation of IPFS.\n- OwlCore.AbstractUI - A set of models with serializable states that can be templated as controls.",

Instead, use SynchronizationContext.Current and related extension methods.\n\n--- 0.4.1 ---\n[Improvements]\nUpdated all dependencies to latest stable version.\n      \n--- 0.4.0 ---\n[Breaking]\nRemoved several transient dependencies such as CommunityToolkit.Mvvm, CommunityToolkit.Common, and Newtonsoft.Json.\n\n--- 0.3.0 ---\n[Breaking]\nOwlCore.AbstractUI has been moved into a separate package.\n\n[Improvements]\nUpdated all dependencies to latest stable version.\n\n--- 0.2.1 ---\n[New]\nUpdated OwlCore.ComponentModel to 0.3.0. No functional changes.\n\n-- 0.2.0 ---\n[Breaking]\nOwlCore.IO.Streams.BitStream has been removed. Please use System.IO.MemoryStream instead.\nThe namespace OwlCore.IO.Streams has been removed.\nInherited breaking changes from OwlCore.Storage 0.8.0.\n\n[Improvements]\nAll dependent packages have been updated to the latest version.\nGracefully handle task cancellation in Flow.Debounce. No longer throws/catches to check for a canceled task. Contributed by @amaidniazi@github.com (amaidhassan@hotmail.com)\n\n--- 0.1.0 ---\nThis package now follows a modified variant of semver2.0, standard across all new OwlCore packages. Breaking changes may occur as a minor version bump if the major version is 0.\n\nThis release marks a major effort to consolidate namespaces and migrate away from deprecated code.\n\n[New]\nOwlCore.Extensions is now in a separate nuget package.\nOwlCore.ComponentModel is now in a separate nuget package.\nOwlCore.Storage has been added as a transitive reference.\nOwlCore.Remoting is now in a separate nuget package and not included as a transitive reference.\nAdded a FlushDefaultValues property to SettingsBase. Default value is true to match existing behavior. When set to false, it will skip writing default values to disk - recommended if your default values never change. \nAdded a FlushOnlyChangedValues property to SettingsBase. Default value is false to match existing behavior. When set to true, only values that are changed in memory will be flushed to storage - recommended if you don't expect others to modify the settings files.\n\n[Improvements]\nIn SettingsBase, when the stream for a setting isn't fully read (which makes deserialization impossible), the setting won't be loaded and LoadFailed will be emitted.\n\n[Breaking changes]\nOwlCore.AbstractStorage has been removed.
