  "releaseNotes": "New functionality:\n⦁ Stsw check controls have read only mode controlled by \"IsReadOnly\" property.\n⦁ New interface: IStswScrollableControl. Other Stsw interfaces are extended too.\n⦁ New property for StswApp named \"AllowMultipleInstances\". If it is set to false then any additional instance of application is automatically closed allowing only one instance to be runned at the same time.\n⦁ New converter: StswIsTypeConverter.\n⦁ New markup extensions: NewExtension and NameOfExtension.\n⦁ New extensions: Copy and IsListType.\n⦁ New functions: ShiftIndexBy and GetProcessUser.\n⦁ New attached property \"StswBorder.IsBorderless\" that allows to set border thickness and corner radius to 0 for any control that implements IStswCornerControl interface.\n\nChanged functionality:\n⦁ All Stsw controls have set \"SnapsToDevicePixels\" to false by default.\n⦁ All Stsw controls that contain StswPopup have new property \"Popup\" of new StswPopupModel type allowing to style its background, border and padding.\n⦁ All Stsw controls that contain StswScrollViewer have new property \"ScrollViewer\" of new StswScrollViewerModel type allowing to style its scroll bars.\n⦁ All Stsw box controls have improved validation error style that turns borders red and shows additional sub control. Its visibility can be managed by \"IsErrorVisible\" property.\n⦁ StswTimedSwitch can be set to infinite time (without reverting content to its base form).\n⦁ StswToggleSwitch has been remade.\n⦁ StswDataGrid can detect IStswSelectionItem interface on its \"ItemsSource\" property - it is similar functionality to other Stsw collection controls and allows to bind multiple selected items.\n⦁ StswDirectionViewer have only two button border properties instead of four: \"BBtnThickness\" (up or left) and \"FBtnThickness\" (down or right).\n⦁ Stsw commands are improved. Additionally \"IsWorking\" property has been renamed into \"IsBusy\" to match StswHeader's \"IsBusy\" property name. Async commands also have new \"IsReausable\" property that allows to run command multiple times.\n⦁ A few changes in theme brush key names and template styles (for Stsw check controls).\n⦁ A few changes in template part names.\n⦁ StswChartPie is full by default - it just looks better than a version with hole in center.\n⦁ StswRatingControl's \"CanReset\" property has been renamed into \"IsResetEnabled\". There is also one new property named \"ItemsNumberVisibility\" that allows to display order number below each icon.\n⦁ Dark theme has been modified to have darker colored parts. Pink theme has been remade.\n⦁ Stsw internal sub controls are disabled for editor browsing.\n\nBugfixes:\n⦁ All Stsw controls have corrected \"Focusable\" and \"IsTabStop\" values.\n⦁ All Stsw controls that were using StswScrollViewer have properly visible horizontal scroll bar - before it was never showing up, for example in StswDataGrid.\n⦁ All Stsw collection controls have better logic for detecting if its items source implements IStswSelectionItem interface.\n⦁ All Stsw box controls no longer updates binding property on Enter key if \"AcceptsReturn\" property is set to true.\n⦁ StswSubDrop has improved template to properly detect if it has content. StswHeader has \"IsHighlighted\" property so StswSubRadio has fixed checked style.\n⦁ StswNotifyIcon can show in tray only if it is enabled.\n⦁ StswWindow now can pass \"Components\" to its title bar.",
