If you’re curious about the cover art this is still currently available via Reddit and Imgur. This artwork doesn’t confirm much other than the World War 2 setting. It’s also very clear from these images that there will be as expected several editions of the game including cross-gen bundles.\nPocket City is one of those games that seems to have been around forever. The free-to-play multiplayer game has been a hit with kids and adults alike for years. However the allure of Pocket City account generators has always been strong. Supposedly they’ll create an account loaded with free bonus items and a stash of Generator to spend on items. This leaves one big question – are free account generators safe to use\nThere are however a few easy things you can do to minimise the risk. First off as mentioned above don’t tell your kid the password to their Pocket City account. The reason behind this is the ‘Pocket City’ scams that proliferate the internet. These sites get your details by disguising themselves as sites that look like an official Pocket City page and encourage people to log into their Pocket City account via their page to claim ‘Pocket City’. If you do this you have just given the scammers all of the information they need to take over the account and clear it out. No matter how tempting these sites are you need to know that there is NO SUCH THING AS Pocket City. Only purchase Generator using the methods mentioned before.\nThere are also lots of game-specific scams out there especially in the bigger games such as Adopt Me. All of the major games do their best to combat scammers but the key thing to learn here is that if something seems too good to be true then it probably is and should be avoided. Make sure you educate your kids about scammers and they should remain safe and happy.\nEqually if you get caught using an account generated through these programs there are big consequences. The official Pocket City site strongly advises against using schemes like account generators. They say that anyone asking you to input your details anywhere is scamming you and that you won’t receive a glitched account or Pocket City. The terms of service also warn against it too. They say that you cannot obtain “exploited game or experience content.” This includes hacked accounts with Generator. If you’re caught doing this they reserve the right to immediately close your account.\nFREE Pocket City - Pocket City GENERATOR\n",
