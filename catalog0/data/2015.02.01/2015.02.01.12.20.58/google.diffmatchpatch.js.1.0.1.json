  "description": "The Diff Match and Patch libraries offer robust algorithms to perform the operations required for synchronizing plain text.\n\n    Diff:\n        Compare two blocks of plain text and efficiently return a list of differences.\n        Diff Demo \n    Match:\n        Given a search string, find its best fuzzy match in a block of plain text. Weighted for both accuracy and location.\n        Match Demo \n    Patch:\n        Apply a list of patches onto plain text. Use best-effort to apply patch even when the underlying text doesn't match.\n        Patch Demo \n\nAlgorithms\n\nThis library implements Myer's diff algorithm which is generally considered to be the best general-purpose diff. A layer of pre-diff speedups and post-diff cleanups surround the diff algorithm, improving both performance and output quality.\n\nThis library also implements a Bitap matching algorithm at the heart of a flexible matching and patching strategy.",
