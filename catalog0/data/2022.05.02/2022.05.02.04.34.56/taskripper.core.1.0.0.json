  "description": "A performant open source library targeted for running N iterations of a delegate in parallel without having\n\t\tto configure or understand too much about multithreading. The library encapsulates the ability to run many \n\t\tdelegates N times, and evenly distribute the work given the number of threads. Most models are interfaces, \n\t\tand therefore can be replaced with your own implementations such as how the work is balanced per thread, \n\t\tand how the executor executes and records information about the execution. The default settings/instances \n\t\tprovided in the library should cover most use cases, however, I've designed the whole system to work mostly\n\t\ton interfaces so that you can modify the behavior of the pipeline as you see fit.\n\n\t\tThe library comes with default implementations of the WorkExecutor, which is responsible for executing the work,\n\t\tgiven a work contract. Also, the most performant way I can think of writing the balancing of each thread without,\n\t\tinspecting the silicone and each core.\n\t\t\n\t\t- Al beit, the new intel processors have a newish technology of distinguishing different cores via performance and efficiency cores.\n\t\tSupport for distinguishing the different types of cores in the CPU will be considered given actual needed support for the balancer \n\t\tto understand these things and if its requested enough. If an obvious deficiency is detected in the performance of the library \n\t\tfor not distinguishing between performance/efficiency cores on a CPU, then this will be prioritized in the future.\n\t\t\n\t\t- At the time of writing this, the experienment of running the TaskRipper exclusively on performance cores vs \n\t\tefficiency cores and the overall performance of them on the operating system alone has not been measured at this time.\n\n\n\t\tTODO\n\t\t- Create a WorkExecutor action/function delegate overload that accepts more than one action/function\n\t\t- - This overload would be like this \n\t\t- - ...WorkExecutor.Execute(workContract, functionToIterateNTimes, functionParameterMutator, cancellationToken)\n\t\t- - This may or may not be possible with just using a single func, but if you want to organize your code, you can \n\t\thave one function to iterate, and another function that is responsible for mutating the state of the other parameter variables.\n\t\t\n\t\tIt is best depend on this package via NuGet to get the latest and greatest updates, and not be subject to maintaining a copied version in the repository in which you are working.\n\t\t\n\t\tCommand line usage to run the benchmarks on the executing machine.\n\t\t`dotnet run -c Release -p TaskRipper.Core.Benchmarks`",
