  "releaseNotes": "General:\n* Added support for web applications using Emscripten, see docs/README-emscripten.md for more information\n* Added support for web applications using Native Client (NaCl), see docs/README-nacl.md for more information\n* Added an API to queue audio instead of using the audio callback:\n    SDL_QueueAudio(), SDL_GetQueuedAudioSize(), SDL_ClearQueuedAudio()\n* Added events for audio device hot plug support:\n    SDL_AUDIODEVICEADDED, SDL_AUDIODEVICEREMOVED\n* Added SDL_PointInRect()\n* Added SDL_HasAVX2() to detect CPUs with AVX2 support\n* Added SDL_SetWindowHitTest() to let apps treat parts of their SDL window like traditional window decorations (drag areas, resize areas)\n* Added SDL_GetGrabbedWindow() to get the window that currently has input grab, if any\n* Added SDL_RenderIsClipEnabled() to tell whether clipping is currently enabled in a renderer\n* Added SDL_CaptureMouse() to capture the mouse to get events while the mouse is not in your window\n* Added SDL_WarpMouseGlobal() to warp the mouse cursor in global screen space\n* Added SDL_GetGlobalMouseState() to get the current mouse state outside of an SDL window\n* Added a direction field to mouse wheel events to tell whether they are flipped (natural) or not\n* Added GL_CONTEXT_RELEASE_BEHAVIOR GL attribute (maps to [WGL|GLX]_ARB_context_flush_control extension)\n* Added EGL_KHR_create_context support to allow OpenGL ES version selection on some platforms\n* Added NV12 and NV21 YUV texture support for OpenGL and OpenGL ES 2.0 renderers\n* Added a Vivante video driver that is used on various SoC platforms\n* Added an event SDL_RENDER_DEVICE_RESET that is sent from the D3D renderers when the D3D device is lost, and from Android's event loop when the GLES context had to be recreated\n* Added a hint SDL_HINT_NO_SIGNAL_HANDLERS to disable SDL's built in signal handling\n* Added a hint SDL_HINT_THREAD_STACK_SIZE to set the stack size of SDL's threads\n* Added SDL_sqrtf(), SDL_tan(), and SDL_tanf() to the stdlib routines\n* Improved support for WAV and BMP files with unusual chunks in them\n* Renamed SDL_assert_data to SDL_AssertData and SDL_assert_state to SDL_AssertState\n* Added a hint SDL_HINT_WINDOW_FRAME_USABLE_WHILE_CURSOR_HIDDEN to prevent window interaction while cursor is hidden\n* Added SDL_GetDisplayDPI() to get the DPI information for a display\n* Added SDL_JoystickCurrentPowerLevel() to get the battery level of a joystick\n* Added SDL_JoystickFromInstanceID(), as a helper function, to get the SDL_Joystick* that an event is referring to.\n* Added SDL_GameControllerFromInstanceID(), as a helper function, to get the SDL_GameController* that an event is referring to.\n\nWindows:\n* Added support for Windows Phone 8.1 and Windows 10/UWP (Universal Windows Platform)\n* Timer resolution is now 1 ms by default, adjustable with the SDL_HINT_TIMER_RESOLUTION hint\n* SDLmain no longer depends on the C runtime, so you can use the same .lib in both Debug and Release builds\n* Added SDL_SetWindowsMessageHook() to set a function to be called for every windows message before TranslateMessage()\n* Added a hint SDL_HINT_WINDOWS_ENABLE_MESSAGELOOP to control whether SDL_PumpEvents() processes the Windows message loop\n* You can distinguish between real mouse and touch events by looking for SDL_TOUCH_MOUSEID in the mouse event \"which\" field\n* SDL_SysWMinfo now contains the window HDC\n* Added support for Unicode command line options\n* Prevent beeping when Alt-key combos are pressed\n* SDL_SetTextInputRect() re-positions the OS-rendered IME\n* Added a hint SDL_HINT_WINDOWS_NO_CLOSE_ON_ALT_F4 to prevent generating SDL_WINDOWEVENT_CLOSE events when Alt-F4 is pressed\n* Added a hint SDL_HINT_XINPUT_USE_OLD_JOYSTICK_MAPPING to use the old axis and button mapping for XInput devices (deprecated)\n\nMac OS X:\n* Implemented drag-and-drop support\n* Improved joystick hot-plug detection\n* The SDL_WINDOWEVENT_EXPOSED window event is triggered in the appropriate situations\n* Fixed relative mouse mode when the application loses/regains focus\n* Fixed bugs related to transitioning to and from Spaces-aware fullscreen-desktop mode\n* Fixed the refresh rate of display modes\n* SDL_SysWMInfo is now ARC-compatible\n* Added a hint SDL_HINT_MAC_BACKGROUND_APP to prevent forcing the application to become a foreground process\n\nLinux:\n* Enabled building with Mir and Wayland support by default.\n* Added IBus IME support\n* Added a hint SDL_HINT_IME_INTERNAL_EDITING to control whether IBus should handle text editing internally instead of sending SDL_TEXTEDITING events\n* Added a hint SDL_HINT_VIDEO_X11_NET_WM_PING to allow disabling _NET_WM_PING protocol handling in SDL_CreateWindow()\n* Added support for multiple audio devices when using Pulseaudio\n* Fixed duplicate mouse events when using relative mouse motion\n\niOS:\n* Added support for iOS 8\n* The SDL_WINDOW_ALLOW_HIGHDPI window flag now enables high-dpi support, and SDL_GL_GetDrawableSize() or SDL_GetRendererOutputSize() gets the window resolution in pixels\n* SDL_GetWindowSize() and display mode sizes are in the \"DPI-independent points\" / \"screen coordinates\" coordinate space rather than pixels (matches OS X behavior)\n* Added native resolution support for the iPhone 6 Plus\n* Added support for MFi game controllers\n* Added support for the hint SDL_HINT_ACCELEROMETER_AS_JOYSTICK\n* Added sRGB OpenGL ES context support on iOS 7+\n* Added support for SDL_DisableScreenSaver(), SDL_EnableScreenSaver() and the hint SDL_HINT_VIDEO_ALLOW_SCREENSAVER\n* SDL_SysWMinfo now contains the OpenGL ES framebuffer and color renderbuffer objects used by the window's active GLES view\n* Fixed various rotation and orientation issues\n* Fixed memory leaks\n\nAndroid:\n* Added a hint SDL_HINT_ANDROID_SEPARATE_MOUSE_AND_TOUCH to prevent mouse events from being registered as touch events\n* Added hints SDL_HINT_ANDROID_APK_EXPANSION_MAIN_FILE_VERSION and SDL_HINT_ANDROID_APK_EXPANSION_PATCH_FILE_VERSION\n* Added support for SDL_DisableScreenSaver(), SDL_EnableScreenSaver() and the hint SDL_HINT_VIDEO_ALLOW_SCREENSAVER\n* Added support for SDL_ShowMessageBox() and SDL_ShowSimpleMessageBox()\n\nRaspberry Pi:\n* Added support for the Raspberry Pi 2",
