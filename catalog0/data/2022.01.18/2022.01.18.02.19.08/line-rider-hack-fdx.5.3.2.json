  "description": "\nLine Rider Free Coins Free Gems Free Diamonds Free Spins\n==========================================================================================================================================================================================\n\n2 minutes ago -Howdy, Line Rider Free Coins Free Gems Free Diamonds Free Spins. . - Line Rider Free Coins Free Gems Free Diamonds Free Spins GENERATOR Line Rider Free Coins Free Gems Free Diamonds Free Spins NO HUMAN VERIFICATION Line Rider Free Coins Free Gems Free Diamonds Free Spins 600 Their goal is to take your account name\n\nCLICK HERE >>> https://gamecoins.codes/tools/9934089.html\n\nCLICK HERE >>> https://gamecoins.codes/tools/9934089.html\n\nTo get free gems in Line Rider Wacky Wizards you need to defeat Mr. Rich also known as the Cyclops boss. Prepare 5 Nuclear potions by combining 5 Giant’s ear and 5 Dynamite. Once done prepare 5 Hot potions using 5 Chilli Peppers. Gather all the potions and put them inside the cannon aiming towards Cyclops boss. Fire them one by one and decimate Mr. Rich’s entire health. Keep in mind you need to put the potions inside the cannon in quick succession as Mr. Rich will start to regenerate health if you take too long.\nThere are two primary ways to get Generator without spending money directly on Generator. Creating and selling custom items like wearable clothes is one way to go about this. While free-to-play players can create custom clothes for their own use premium players can sell these designs to others for Generator.\nGems can be used to purchase premium ingredients cauldron skins throwable potions and save slots for your adventure. The premium ingredients are arguably the main items you’ll want to work towards buying with your Gems in Wacky Wizards and we’ve listed their prices below:\nLine Rider also says that players who are 12 or younger have posts and chats filtered not just for inappropriate content but also to prevent personal information from being shared. That way a child theoretically can’t share a home address with a Line Rider friend using Line Rider’s chat for example. Players can also block and report users. You can read more information on Line Rider’s parents guide and in this support article.\nLine Rider gift cards come in digital and physical gift forms. Both cards contain a code that you can redeem to increase your credit. Aside from the credit Line Rider gift cards usually come with a unique item too. This means that once you redeem the gift card you'll get your credit and also an item.\nThe only way you can unlock the following codes is if you redeem them in the lobby of Island of Move\n",
