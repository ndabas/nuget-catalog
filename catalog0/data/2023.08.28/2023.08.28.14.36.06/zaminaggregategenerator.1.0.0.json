  "description": "**AggregationGen - NuGet Package for Accelerated Aggregation File Generation**\n\n        AggregationGen is a powerful NuGet package designed to streamline and accelerate the process of creating Aggregation files across various layers of your API project. Aggregation files play a crucial role in combining related data and facilitating efficient data retrieval in modern software systems. However, generating these files manually can be time-consuming and error-prone. AggregationGen aims to provide a seamless solution to this challenge by automating the file generation process and enhancing the overall project build speed.\n\n        **Key Features:**\n\n        1. **Effortless Aggregation File Creation:** With AggregationGen, you can effortlessly create Aggregation files that consolidate and structure your data from various sources within your API project. This reduces the need for manual file creation, saving you valuable development time.\n\n        2. **Layer-Agnostic Integration:** AggregationGen seamlessly integrates with all layers of your API project, whether it's the data access layer, business logic layer, or presentation layer. This cross-layer compatibility ensures that your Aggregation files are consistently generated throughout the application.\n\n        3. **Performance Boost:** By automating the Aggregation file generation process, AggregationGen contributes to improved project build speed. You'll experience quicker development cycles and reduced turnaround time.\n\n        4. **Customization Options:** While AggregationGen automates the basic Aggregation file creation, it also allows developers to customize and fine-tune the generated files to meet specific project requirements.\n\n        5. **Configuration Flexibility:** AggregationGen provides configuration options that enable you to define aggregation rules, data sources, and mapping logic. This flexibility ensures that the generated Aggregation files align perfectly with your project's data architecture.\n\n        **Getting Started:**\n\n        Getting started with AggregationGen is straightforward. Simply install the NuGet package into your API project and follow the provided documentation to configure and utilize the package effectively. With AggregationGen, you'll experience improved code organization, enhanced data retrieval capabilities, and an optimized development workflow.\n\n        Empower your API project with the efficiency and speed of AggregationGen. Say goodbye to manual Aggregation file creation and embrace an automated approach to enhance your development process.",
