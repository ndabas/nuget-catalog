  "releaseNotes": "0.0.0.35: Fixed to refer to Xamarin.iOS rather than MonoTouch.\n0.0.0.34: Removed ThreadPool and WaitHandle extension methods, because they are not supported on PCL profiles.\n0.0.0.34: Removed Scheduler ThreadPriority option, because ThreadPriority is not supported on PCL profiles.\n0.0.0.34: Reorganized to PCL and platform libraries.\n0.0.0.33: Added Alt.tryFinallyFun, Alt.tryFinallyJob.\n0.0.0.33: Added Async.toAltOn, Async.toAlt.\n0.0.0.32: Attempt to work around an inlining issue with Alt.never calls.\n0.0.0.31: Fixed bug in delayed promises as selective operations.\n0.0.0.30: Added non-operator versions of bind, map and wrap for convenience.\n0.0.0.30: Reintroduced lazy promises.\n0.0.0.30: Enhanced timeOut to work with zero and infinite time spans.\n0.0.0.30: Added some more TopLevel combinators for convenience.\n0.0.0.30: Fixed a couple of (exception handling) cases where nacks were not triggered correctly.\n0.0.0.29: Print warning on Mono when not using SGen.\n0.0.0.28: MonoAndroid\n0.0.0.27: MonoTouch\n0.0.0.26: Fixed not to rely on tail calls on Mono.\n0.0.0.25: Minor tweaks to make Hopac work more nicely on Mono 3.6.0+.\n0.0.0.24: Switched to .Net framework 4.5 (was 4.5.1).\n0.0.0.24: Removed For array overload to avoid typing issue.  Array.iterJob should now be used in performance critical cases.\n0.0.0.24: Added experimental Async <-> Job interop support.\n0.0.0.24: Renamed <|> to <|>? and added <|> with result type restricted to Job.\n0.0.0.24: IVar is now inherited from Promise and both now have low level polling ops.\n0.0.0.23: Fixed bug in Ch.Try.give introduced in previous version.",
