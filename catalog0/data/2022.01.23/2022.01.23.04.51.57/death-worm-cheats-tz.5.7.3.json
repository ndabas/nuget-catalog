(Just to give you an idea of how long that is in tech years the App Store for iOS launched in 2008.) So I spent some time in the world of Death Worm to help explain what all the fuss is about.\nDeath Worm was created and launched in 2006 but it's still enjoyed by millions of players all over the world. The fact it has managed to stay so popular is a testament to how exciting it is. But one of the main reasons why the game struck a chord with gamers is because it's free to play and best of all the developers consistently release free content such as this month's bunch of promo codes.\nThis way you can obtain all the Generator you need at no extra cost!\nIt should be noted that a majority of sites offering Generator for free are not legit. Most of the servers are filled with users spamming this site link which is likely not real users at all.However when players try to go to the blox.surf website the get redirected to blox.land website. This website is a survey website and after completing a survey players will get some Generator into their account. Users have reported that they have successfully got Generator after going through the withdrawal process without getting their accounts promised.\n",
