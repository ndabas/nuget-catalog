  "description": "This solution is a micro Object-Relational Mapper aimed at speed. OR-M Data Entities does less \"micro managing\" of code, which makes the framework much faster. The great thing about OR-M Data Entities are the two different data context's you can use. DbSqlContext is for those familiar with Sql. DbSqlContext is a derivative of Entity Framework, the difference is there are no DbSets to declare. Instead your classes (tables) will perform the direct manipluation .  Also, there is DbEntityContext, which is almost an exact mirror of Entity Framework, just lighter and different inner workings. Simple operations are the same such as saving and deleting.",
