This is not the same type of strategy game as command and conquer, but it is a fun fix for mobile gamers that want to control an army in island based warfare.  \n \nBoom Beach takes place in an island setting with in-game currency like gems, gold and diamonds which play a central role in building your defense, mounting an offense and upgrading capabilities. This is nothing new for strategy games, but Boom Beach is heavily tilted to make the player spend real world money on in-app purchases to get more gems, which can buy extra resources and speed the game up. It is still fun to play Boom Beach, but everyone who plays will be tempted to spend cash to avoid waiting between moves.  \n \nIf you want to progress faster and unlock new buildings, weapons and troops without spending real money youâ€™ll need to use these Boom Beach tips and tricks to have more fun and progress faster. There are no Boom Beach cheats available at this time, and setting the clock ahead will trigger a notification that a building is complete, but when returning to the game it will still be in process. No combination of changing the time and opening or closing the game works as a Boom Beach cheat to build faster.Boom Beach is free for iPhone and iPad and is the Boom Beach Android release is coming soon.
