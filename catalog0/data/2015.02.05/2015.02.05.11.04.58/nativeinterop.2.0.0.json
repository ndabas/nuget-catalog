  "description": "Extends the NativeInterop.NativePtr module from FSharp.Core with 64-bit capabilities and exposes the functionality in an OOP-friendly manner as NativePtr<T> (raw pointer operations on pointers of type T* where T is an unmanaged type), extension methods to System.IntPtr and NativeArray64<T> (a generic native 64-bit array of items of unmanaged type T) to C# and VB (and F#, of course). The included System.IO.Stream extension methods as well as the Buffer module enable easy and efficient handling of structured binary data.",
