After languishing for two years Splitgate found major success recently. The free-to-play game has been downloaded more than two million times so far and has received almost universal acclaim. Now there is more good news for Splitgate fans on console as the studio has announced the game will have its own upgraded version for current-gen consoles.\nIf these new spaces were indeed to emerge it’s worth considering the issue of control and mediation of information. The internet as we know it today wasn’t developed by any one single entity but built collaboratively around open standards and protocols including notably net neutrality. Whether such principles would govern this would-be internet successor is a topic of debate. If any company were able to consolidate power over the Metaverse’s formation and become its de facto gatekeeper the control they could wield over the dissemination of information and in setting their own commercial and security practices would be enormous.\nHOW TO GET Draw a Stickman EPIC HOW TO GET Draw a Stickman EPIC NO HUMAN VERIFICATION\nDraw a Stickman EPIC GENERATOR Draw a Stickman EPIC STUDIO\nEach of these codes gives players a specific special item so players should test them out to see what rewards they get.
