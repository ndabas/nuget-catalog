  "description": "Author's note: Although many frameworks already exist for working with settings, most are complicated or over engineered for simple usage scenarios. I reluctantly created NSettings because I needed a library that satisfied these specific needs: the public API is simple and obvious; the dependencies and runtime footprint are as small as possible; settings are key/value pairs and the keys may optionally be saved in named groups; the backing storage is customisable. The library contains implementations that use the Registry or an XML file as backing storage.",

  "releaseNotes": "The ListGroups method results now include the null (unnamed) group if it contains any keys, which simplifies enumerating all groups and keys. The ListGroups and ListKeys results are case-insensitive ordinal sorted, which makes them more deterministic. The experimental SQL Server and Azure Table implementation projects have been removed.",
