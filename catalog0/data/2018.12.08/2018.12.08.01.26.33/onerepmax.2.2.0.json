  "releaseNotes": "This release comes with a number of changes. I swear, I will leave the library alone for a while unless a bug surfaces (feel free to submit them!).\n\nChanges with this release:\n\n1. Reverted the namespace back due to popular demand (sorry).\n\n2. I removed the Common formula because it was brought to my attention that it was mathematically equivalent to the Epley formula.\n\n3. Added a new object type called FormulaInfo that stores the formula enumeration, name, description, plain text formula, MathML formula and LaTeX syntax formula.\n\n4. OneRepMax now generates a list of FormulaInfo objects of all the implemented formulas.\n\n5. OneRepMax can also build a list based on a parameterized list. This allows developers means to create a list of FormulaInfo objects of only the formulas they want to use. These will be created in the order they are submitted.\n\n6. There is also the ability to generate just one FormulaInfo object at a time, using a formula type enumeration as a parameter.\n\n7. A new object called StrengthCompare provides functionality to compare strength of two or more lifters regardless of weight. This occurs through the Wilks score and a common formula sometimes referred to as the 2/3 power formula.\n\nI've tried to be as descriptive and as clear as possible in the XML comments. However, if you have some questions or something doesn't make sense, please contact me at svespie@gmail.com.\n\nAlso, please do not hesitate to provide feedback, request features, or submit bugs / fixes.\n\nI'm sorry for the need to refactor mutliple times in the past month. I'll try to limit that kind of behavior for the future. \n\nEnjoy!",
