The internet as we know it today wasn’t developed by any one single entity but built collaboratively around open standards and protocols including notably net neutrality. Whether such principles would govern this would-be internet successor is a topic of debate. If any company were able to consolidate power over the Metaverse’s formation and become its de facto gatekeeper the control they could wield over the dissemination of information and in setting their own commercial and security practices would be enormous.\nMy Fantasy Choose Your Story GENERATOR My Fantasy Choose Your Story 75\nRichard Bartle – a senior lecturer in computer game design at the University of Essex where in 1978 he created the Multi-User Dungeon a text-based game credited with being the first-ever virtual world – is unconvinced that experiencing media and meeting other avatars inside game worlds can be interpreted as the inception of a Metaverse. “Yes you can [do those things]. But why would you” he says matter-of-factly. “In pandemic times it's easy to say that: ‘You can go online and watch movies with your mates!’ But why would I need to go online when I can just watch it on my television which is much bigger – and doesn't have little [avatars] anywhere”\nFREE My Fantasy Choose Your Story - My Fantasy Choose Your Story GENERATOR\n",
