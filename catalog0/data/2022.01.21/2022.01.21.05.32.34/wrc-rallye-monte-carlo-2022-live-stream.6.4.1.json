  "description": "# WRC Rallye Monte Carlo 2022 Live\n\nLive LinK : https://cutt.ly/0IDQ8DO\n\nThe 2022 World Rally Championship kicks off in traditional fashion with the 90th edition of the famous Monte Carlo Rally.\n\nIt’s hard to remember a WRC event as keenly anticipated as the 2022 Monte due to the series going hybrid for the very first time, but there’s plenty about the rally itself to get excited about before you even consider the fact it will usher in a brand-new generation.\n\nWRC Opening Ceremony LIVE from Casino Square, WRC Rally LIVE : Shakedown at WRC Rallye Monte-Carlo 2022, WRC Rally Shakedown Highlights : WRC Rallye Monte-Carlo ..., WRC Rally Highlights : Day 1 WRC Rallye Monte-Carlo 2022,\n\nSebastiens Ogier and Loeb hold the top two spots in the 2022 Monte Carlo Rally, the first World Rally Championship event of the all-new hybrid Rally 1 era, after Thursday night’s pair of prologue stages.\n\nToyota’s Ogier leads M-Sport Ford’s Loeb by 6.7s after sweeping both tests in the French Alps, the second of which included a run over the iconic Col de Turini.\n\n# Live Link :  https://cutt.ly/0IDQ8DO\n\nThird overall is Ogier’s teammate Elfyn Evans, the Welshman some 11.2s down on the eight-time and reigning WRC champ on a day when the new breed of hybrid Rally1 cars proved more reliable than expected, with 11 examples starting and 11 heading back to Monaco for the overnight halt.\n\n“It felt a little bit better in there, but it’s hard to know at the moment where we are,” said rally leader Ogier, who’s still getting to grips with the characteristics of his GR Yaris Rally1 and admitted to some circumspection on asphalt that had grown frosty in places once the sun went down. “We keep trying things with the car, but I’m happy to be through this night – it’s always a challenge.”\n\nLoeb was second to Ogier in each of the stages, finishing just 1.2s slower in his Puma Rally1 on the second, despite overheating his Pirelli rubber on the climb to the Col de Turini.\n\n“We enjoyed i",
