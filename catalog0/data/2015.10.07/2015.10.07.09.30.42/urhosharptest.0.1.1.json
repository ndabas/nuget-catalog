  "description": "UrhoSharp is a lightweight Game Engine suitable for using with C# and F# to create games that run\non Android, iOS, Mac, Windows and Unix.   The game engine is available as a portable\nclass library, allowing your game code to be written once and shared across all platforms.\n\nUrhoSharp is powered by Urho3D (http://urho3d.github.io/), a game engine that has been \nunder development for more than a decade.   All the samples from Urho3D have been ported\nto C# to help you get started:\n\nhttps://github.com/xamarin/urho-samples\n\nAmong the features of the Urho3D you will find:\n\n•\tDirect3D9, Direct3D11v1.4, OpenGL 2.0 or 3.2v1.4, OpenGL ES 2.0 or WebGLv1.4 rendering\n•\tHLSL or GLSL shaders + caching of HLSL bytecode\n•\tConfigurable rendering pipeline. Default implementations for forward, light pre-pass and deferred rendering\n•\tComponent based scene model\n•\tSkeletal (with hardware skinning), vertex morph and node animation\n•\tAutomatic instancing on SM3 capable hardware\n•\tPoint, spot and directional lights\n•\tShadow mapping for all light types; cascaded shadow maps for directional lights\n•\tParticle rendering\n•\tGeomipmapped terrain\n•\tStatic and skinned decals\n•\tAuxiliary view rendering (reflections etc.)\n•\tGeometry, material & animation LOD\n•\tSoftware rasterized occlusion culling\n•\tPost-processing\n•\tHDR renderingv1.31\n•\t2D sprites and particles that integrate into the 3D scenev1.31\n•\tTask-based multithreading\n•\tHierarchical performance profiler\n•\tScene and object load/save in binary and XML format\n•\tKeyframe animation of object attributesv1.32\n•\tBackground loading of resourcesv1.32\n•\tKeyboard, mouse, joystick and touch input (if available)\n•\tCross-platform support using SDL 2.0 (currently runs on Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, Android, iOS, Raspberry Piv1.3, and HTML5v1.4 with Emscripten toolchain)\n•\tPhysics using Bullet\n•\t2D physics using Box2Dv1.32\n•\tScripting using AngelScript\n•\tAlternative script interface using Luav1.3 or LuaJITv1.31 (on Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, Android, and Raspberry Pi)\n•\tNetworking using kNet + possibility to make HTTP requestsv1.3\n•\tPathfindingv1.23 and crowd simulationv1.4 using Recast/Detour\n•\tImage loading using stb_image + DDS / KTX / PVR compressed texture support\n•\t2D and “3D” audio playback, Ogg Vorbis support using stb_vorbis + WAV format support\n•\tTrueType font rendering using FreeType, AngelCode bitmap fonts are also supported\n•\tUnicode string support\n•\tInbuilt UI system\n•\tScene editor and UI-layout editor implemented in script with undo & redo capabilities\n•\tModel/scene/animation/material import from formats supported by Open Asset Import Library\n•\tAlternative model/animation import from OGRE mesh.xml and skeleton.xml files\n•\tSupported IDEs: Visual Studio, Xcode, Eclipse, CodeBlocks, QtCreator, CLion\n•\tSupported compiler toolchains: MSVC, GCC, Clang, MinGW, and their cross-compiling derivatives\n•\tSupports both 32-bit and 64-bitv1.3 build\n•\tBuild as single external libraryv1.3 (can be linked against statically or dynamically)",
