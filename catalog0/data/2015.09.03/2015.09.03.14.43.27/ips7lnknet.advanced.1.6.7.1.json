  "releaseNotes": "= 26.02.2015 - V1.6.7.0 =\n* New       Implemented SiemensChannelType enumeration on SiemensDevice to manage the type of\n            channel to use on a connection created by the SiemensDevice instead to manage\n            it via the generic PlcDeviceConnection using the PlcDeviceConnectionType.\n            In general a channel type is only relevant for the Siemens provider. Therefore the\n            PlcDeviceConnectionType will become obsolete in future releases.\n* New       Improved GetInfo() method on SiemensDeviceConnection to not longer produce\n            re-occuring connection status changes and status evaluations.\n* Fixed     Wrong calculation of End Address of PlcType instances representing a Bool[].\n* New       Implemented check in PlcType to disallow the use of a different PlcAddress.RawType as\n            Bit for PlcType instances with PlcTypeCode.Bool.\n\n= 24.02.2015 - V1.6.6.1 =\n* New       Reworked implementation to better take use of the maximum string length property\n            (Length). Additionally care about the PlcString.MinLength and PlcString.MaxLength\n            and do not longer pad value with whitespaces.\n* Fixed     Issue with wrong type of buffer array (changed short buffer to float buffer).\n* New       Fixed issue with out dated return data from ReadValues.\n\n= 23.02.2015 - V1.6.6.0 =\n* New       In case of Multi-Read (ReadValues) and Multi-Write (WriteValues) the connection does\n            not longer reflect data status codes. Data status codes are now stored on the\n            connection using the PlcType used and on each IPlcValue instance specific PlcStatus.\n\n=  19.02.2015 - V1.6.5.0 =\n* New       Improved Exception and Status information.\n* New       Improved Status and Value change handling in transactional way.\n* Fixed     Multi-Threaded problem in PlcType.Of(...)\n\n= 09.02.2015 - V1.6.4.0 =\n* New       Implemented new overloads for GetValue and SetValue. Additionally implemented\n            ValidateValue. Furthermore reworked mechanism to get and set the Value property and\n            the implementation of GetValue and SetValue to better integrate with new solutions and\n            provide more meaningful codeflows for deriving classes.\n* Fixed     Fixed issues with reading and writing char values.\n* New       Upgraded to IPS7LnkNet V1.0.74.0\n            * Fixed     Connection to PLC didn't repair itself automatically.\n            * Fixed     Using threads with connections: License expired appeard several times.\n\n= 15.12.2014 - V1.6.3.4 =\n* Fixed     Issue with duplicate PlcOperand instances in multi-threaded environments.\n\n= 10.12.2014 - V1.6.3.3 =\n* Fixed     Issue with ReadValues on a PlcDeviceConnection which lead to same references to\n            the internal data buffer on different PlcValue instances with the same PlcType.\n\n= 28.11.2014 - V1.6.3.2 =\n* Fixed     Issue with failed auto connect attempts then starting a communication while the\n            network device is disabled at start and enabled during further connect/access\n            attempts.\n* New       Updated IPS7LnkNet (V1.73): Logo/S7-200 license managment implemented.",
