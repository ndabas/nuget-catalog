  "releaseNotes": "Version 5.1.6 - April 11, 2016\n- Added: TGA (TARGA) format support for thumbnails and Image Viewer.\n- Improved: In Document Viewer, when session expires, a \"Refresh page\" dialog will be shown with a countdown of 10 seconds.\n  Also server side errors while loading the document will be handled better and more detailed error messages will be\n  displayed instead of a generic message.\n\nVersion 5.1.5 - April 4, 2016\n- Added: \"Print\" permission for controlling print, download as pdf and text selection actions in the document viewer.\n- Changed: Removed DisablePreviewerPrinting and DisablePreviewerTextSelection properties as these will now be controlled \n  by the new Print permission per folder-basis.\n- Improved: The Document Viewer;\n\t- Added: \"Download\" and \"Download as PDF\" buttons to the toolbar.\n\t  \"Download\" button will be disabled when there is no Download permission and \"Download as PDF\" button \n\t  will be disabled when there is no Print permission. This is because, downloading a DOCX file as a PDF file is \n\t  considered same as printing that document.\n\t- Improved: The toolbar is now reponsive, buttons will not be hidden and they will flow naturally to next row below.\n\t  So all the available buttons will be visible regardless of the viewer size. Also the buttons are spaced better.\n\t- Fixed: Some scanned documents were displayed as blurred, i.e. the text was unreadable.\n\t- Fixed: Some XPS files were not being displayed at all.\n\t- Fixed: Even when the printing was disabled, the user could still open \"Print Dialog\" by pressing CTRL + P.\n- Changed: CreatePublicLink permission value is changed from 16384 to 1073741824 (1 << 30). If you were serializing this\n  value to somewhere, you should update the stored value.\n- Added: New examples engine with flat/modern theme.\n\nVersion 5.1.0 - March 24, 2016\n- Added: New redesigned Document Viewer with same features.",
