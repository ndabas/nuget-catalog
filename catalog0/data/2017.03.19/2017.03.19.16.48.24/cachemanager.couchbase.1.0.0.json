  "releaseNotes": "This is finally the 1.0 release. \nIt has been some time but after migration the solution to the new csproj format and Visual Studio 2017, it was about time ;)\n\nThanks everyone for supporting this library and sending in either feature requests, questions or bug reports!\n\n**New Things**\n* New serializer(s) based on [Microsoft.Bond](https://github.com/Microsoft/bond) supporting all three Bond serializers! #127 \n* Eviction based events reacting on the cache vendor specific evictions see #116 \n  * New event on `BaseCacheManager` with information about which cache handle and why the event was triggered\n  * With this, CacheManager now can sync the cache `Up`.\n\n**Minor New Things**\n* Dictionary Cache Handle now has a timer based eviction loop which should be more reliable.\n* The Memcached cache handle now finally has a working clear region function #104\n* All serializers can be used via Microsoft's configuration extensions as known types (also added to the json schema)\n* Memcached and Redis cache handles now can be configured to use an already initialized client. The `WithxyzHandle` extension methods have new overloads to pass in the existing client. #118\n\n**Bug Fixes** \n* #134 Serialization had some issues in some cases with loading the correct Types\n* #136 when working with absolute expiration, there were some odds when renewing the expiration date\n* Memcached handle had a bug in version 0.9.3 when configured via xml configuration section, see #118 \n\n**Breaking Changes**\n* UpdateMode `Full` has been removed \n* Minimum netstandard has been increased to 1.2 from 1.1 for the `Core` package\n\nPlease report any bugs on github, and feel free to ask questions on either StackOverflow with the `[cachemanager]` tag or on our (moved) homepage http://cachemanager.michaco.net.\n",
