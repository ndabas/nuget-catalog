[Free Gems!] Brawl Stars Gems Generator 2021 Hacker Tools No Survey Working Cheats 100% Brawl Stars Free Gems .\n\nHereâ€™s some basic tips to getting started if youâ€™re a complete n00b:The game allows you to enter a map, most commonly with 2 other players, in a 3v3 set up (this depends on the events, but weâ€™ll get to that in a minute).You play as a Brawler. These Brawlers are the gameâ€™s characters. There are currently 15 Brawlers available. You start with one and as you play you unlock new brawlers. These brawlers also have various types. Some are fighters or healers while others are assassins or sharp shooters. Each brawler as an Attack, Super and Star Power. One of our favourite n00b brawlers is Nita. The evil little kid in the bear hat. She is able to rupture or play overbearing depending on what you need but her Star Power is Bear With Me\n\nwhere she releases her own bear into the arena to fight on her behalf.The more you play, the more brawlers you unlock. The best way to learn their skills is to play with them and level them up. Easy!Now\n\n#BBBBB",
