  "description": "New users: please use 1.0.5-rc1 for now.\nMS Dynamics CRM users: merging in Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk may crash your plugin, exclude it from the merge with Copy Local=false.\n\nMSBuild ILMerge task allows you to use the famous ILMerge utility (ILMerge nuget package, see http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/people/mbarnett/ILMerge.aspx) in automated builds and/or Visual Studio 2012 projects.\n      It is similar to the ILMerge.MSBuild.Tasks nuget package, originally published by neoeinstein@gmail.com (that seems to be abandoned) with the following additional features:\n      - It supports all the latest ILMerge options;\n      - ILMerge.exe is discovered as package dependency;\n      - The .targets file overrides the CopyFilesToOutputDirectory build target, leaving the AfterBuild target free for further customizaton;\n      - It attempts to guess the reasonable merge order for the included assemblies and lets you to finetune it with a configuration file.\n\n      ILMerge.exe is not included into this package because its license prohibits redistribution. Referencing it as package dependency and loading it from its package location ensures that the latest ILMerge version is always used.",
