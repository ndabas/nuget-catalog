  "description": "This library implements an in-process database for storing and retrieving class objects and their property values. The library is designed to be as easy to use as possible, with a small footprint and trivial dependencies. The backing storage is the Microsoft Extensible Storage Engine (ESENT) high-performance, high-capacity, transactional database which is built into all modern versions of Windows. The ObjectDb runtime is implemented as two small managed libraries which are added as project references.",
