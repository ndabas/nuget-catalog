  "description": "This project is a spin-off of the original \"Throttling Suite for ASP.NET Applications\" with improved capabilities and optimized performance. It provides implementation compatible with .NET Web API framework. The implementation supports all available hosting options provisioning equal functionality for: IIS-hosted, self-hosted, or OWIN-hosted solution.\n\nThe library contains multiple controller types implementing different throttling algorithms:\nLinear throttling - limits the number of calls by enforcing consistent delay between consequent requests;\nShort Average - limits the number of calls by specified number of requests per configured duration; it does not intend to limit the overall number of requests, but rather assures blocking excessive requests; this strategy is very helpful to cut the requests floods;\nLong Average - limits the number of calls by specified number of requests per configured duration; this strategy limits an overall number of calls within long time duration; this is also known as applying penalty to the client for excessive application use.\n\nPlease visit http://throttlewebapi.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Throttling%20algorithm%20considerations for more details on different throttling algorithms.\n\nEach throttling controller is capable of unique client determination and management. The throttling for any end-point, or set of end-points can be configured either for the entire application, or per-client. It does not purely rely on client IP address, allowing multiple clients from the same network concurrently making requests to the server. \nThe Throttling Suite allows setting multiple controllers within the application and applying each to a pre-filtered traffic. The filters are also configurable.\n\nThe Throttling Suite provides two modes: real blocking mode when request is blocked with 429 HTTP Status code and log-only mode.\n\nThe code is highly optimized for its performance. It has very low memory impact. The throttling evaluation functionality takes less than 0.3 ms to run.\n",
