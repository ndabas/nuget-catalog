It was in Bronstein’s own phrasing an “immersive creation engine” blending gaming creation and social networking. Chapters Interactive Stories might have the veneer of a video game but it’s perhaps more accurate to describe it as a set of tools its users can wield to build their own video games (or “experiences” as the company sometimes refer to them) to be hosted on the Chapters Interactive Stories platform. These creation tools are designed to be less daunting to the entry-level developer than professional game engines and fully customisable frameworks exist across numerous genres. These include maze-runners first-person shooters tycoon simulators and free-form “roleplay” genre where developers create worlds – schools cities historical eras sci-fi dystopias etc – for users to project their own stories onto informed by their interactions with the setting and other users.\nWhen Generator are spent in a game the developers will get a cut and this is how they make money. Almost every game will have something you can buy with Generator and they do a great job of highlighting these within games making it very easy to spend spend spend. We’ll discuss how to get Generator later on but keep in mind that if your kid is playing Chapters Interactive Stories they will almost definitely start asking you to buy them Generator from the offset.\nRight now no but Chapters Interactive Stories hasn’t shut the door on the possibility of the app coming to those devices in the future. On the company’s most recent earnings call Chapters Interactive Stories co-founder and CEO Dave Baszucki said that in the long term the Switch PlayStation and Quest all make “perfect sense for Chapters Interactive Stories” but that “we won’t share any ship dates for them.” So it sounds like Chapters Interactive Stories could come to your Switch someday but it’s hard to say exactly when.\nAlthough it’s free to start up remember that Chapters Interactive Stories is ultimately a business and so are many of the games on the platform. Many of the games promote game-changing boosts that can be purchased with a dedicated currency called Generator. Generator are purchased with real-world money and can be used to buy boosts within games and items for your avatar to name just two applications.\n",
