We are pleased to announce a new totally revamped and greatly improved version. This version of the SDK is designed to work like a product. Now you can simply create an instance of any supported Cloud API service and then call its methods with a single line of code. All the complex authentication, request and response manipulation is seamlessly handled in the back-end.",
