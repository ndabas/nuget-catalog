Most of the Double Down promotions codes expire for 24- 72 hours except Doubledown Flashgiveaway that expires for 5 hours. All codes posted worked for me when i posted them.

You can collect codes on your PC/Laptop and mobile device.\n\nIf you follow my Facebook group you already know that i only post working DDC promo codes and people trust me. I do not ask anything in return for the codes i give out to the community.To Collect codes from my page is very easy.
