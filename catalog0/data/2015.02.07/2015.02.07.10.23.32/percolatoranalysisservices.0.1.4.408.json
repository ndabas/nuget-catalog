  "releaseNotes": "Finally, a way to query a Microsoft SQL Server Analysis Database with LINQ and type safe objects! \n\nBeta version - Comes without any warranties.  Please contact me via the \"Contact Owners\" link for any questions, comments, bugs, or features you think should be included. Make sure to read the \"Documentation\" text file that is included with the package. \n\n*This is a quick update - Apologies for not including the \"Documentation.txt\" file that should have been included with the project.\n\nChanges: \n-Fixed an issue when creating global query scoped members and sets.  It's not possible to create global query scoped calculated measures and sets from you cube's partial class without the need for the \"WithSet\" or \"WithMember\" attribute.  Simply create the property in the partial class, returning either s Set or Member object.\n\nComing Changes:\n- Working on an issue with a sub cube using linq is not property translating, resulting in empty results being returned from the query.\n\n-Changing the generator to only generate each dimension once, and sharing them among their respective cube classes.",
