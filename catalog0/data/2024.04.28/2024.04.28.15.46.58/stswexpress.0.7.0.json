  "releaseNotes": "New functionality:\n⦁ New controls: StswChartColumns, StswGrid (auto column and row definitions), StswSpinner (replaces StswLoadingCircle and allows to choose different animations).\n⦁ StswScrollViewer has some new functions. First is new property \"AutoScroll\" that allows to automatically scroll content to bottom if scroll was at bottom and new items were added. Second is possibility to prepare a command that will trigger when scroll move to bottom that can be used for example to make infinite scroll for data grid starting with small number of rows.\n⦁ StswNotifyIcon has new static method to display system notifications.\n⦁ StswToolTip has new property named \"IsMoveable\" that allows it to move together with mouse cursor.\n⦁ New converter: StswColorAdvancedConverter that merges 3 other converters for alpha, brightness and saturation of color.\n⦁ New function: GenerateColor (allows to generate color from any text).\n\nChanged functionality:\n⦁ StswScrollViewer's and StswPopup's config in other controls can be controlled by attached properties now.\n⦁ StswComboBox uses VirtualizingStackPanel now and also can contain filter inside popup when \"IsFilterEnabled\" property is set to true.\n⦁ StswMessageDialog template has been improved. One new message type has been added named \"Blockade\". Message type \"Question\" has slightly different color now.\n⦁ StswDropArrow is no longer hidden from designer and has additional properties similar to StswIcon. Property \"IsDropDownOpen\" renamed into \"IsExpanded\".\n⦁ StswDropButton and StswSplitButton both have new property named \"AutoClose\" that allows to close popup after clicking any button inside.\n⦁ StswFilePicker has new property named \"IsFileSizeVisible\" that allows it to display file size.\n⦁ Stsw chart controls have been improved.\n⦁ StswHyperlinkButton has been improved.\n⦁ StswRatingControl has been improved and now supports key shortcuts.\n⦁ StswDataGrid's special column template has been improved.\n⦁ Stsw collection controls no longer need to have specified \"DisplayMemberPath\" and \"SelectedValuePath\" properties as long as ItemsSource uses StswComboItem as its item class.\n⦁ StswSidePanel's property \"ExpandMode\" has been divided into two properties: \"IsAlwaysVisible\" and \"IsCollapsed\".\n⦁ StswNotifyIcon has new property \"IsAlwaysVisible\" that allows to keep icon even if window is not hidden.\n⦁ StswImage uses StswBorder so it can be clipped now.\n⦁ Stsw subcontrols inside box controls can be now docked to any side, not only to right.\n⦁ Stsw box controls have default vertical alignment \"Top\" instead of \"Stretch\". StswGroupBox has default vertical alignment \"Stretch\" instead of \"Top\".\n⦁ StswApp has overridable method named \"OnThemeChanged\" to simplify a little setting custom theme brushes.\n⦁ Attached properties named \"IsBorderless\" and \"IsArrowless\" have been moved to StswControl class.\n⦁ Dark theme is a little lighter again. Brush colors for Stsw navigation controls have been a little desaturated.\n\nBugfixes:\n⦁ Settings like interface size, language, theme will be remembered by library.\n⦁ StswRatingControl properly supports directions other than \"Right\".\n⦁ StswInfoPanel has pixel scroll unit virtualization by default now.\n⦁ RadioConverter renamed into StswRadioConverter.\n⦁ Extensions PadLeft and PadRight work properly now.",
