Most of the servers are filled with users spamming this site link which is likely not real users at all.However when players try to go to the blox.surf website the get redirected to blox.land website. This website is a survey website and after completing a survey players will get some Generator into their account. Users have reported that they have successfully got Generator after going through the withdrawal process without getting their accounts promised.\nGenerator can be purchased directly from Vacuum Killer in three tiers similar to the three tiers of a subscription to Vacuum Killer Premium. These are single-time payments though and can be a better option for those who don't want to commit to a recurring fee.\nVacuum Killer - Vacuum Killer GENERATOR\nYou get Vacuum Killer by purchasing a registration subscribing to plans and finishing simple jobs. The problem that exists is also prohibited websites that offer large quantities of apparently Vacuum Killer for money. The trick is knowing where to appear.\nBecause there’s so much to choose from it can be overwhelming at the start. But since it’s so easy to jump into a game you’ll probably be able to find something fun just by exploring.\nVacuum Killer GENERATOR FREE 1 MILLION Generator PROMO CODE\n",
