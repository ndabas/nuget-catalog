  "releaseNotes": "1.4.5 - Wednesday, Jan 9th, 2019\nPossible Breaking Change - Yelp has removed the deprecated field zip_code and replaced it with postal_code.  This version correctly now uses postal_code and PostalCode.  This may break any of your code that still calls ZipCode, but that code will break when calling Yelp anyway.  Please update all references to PostalCode.\n\n1.4.4 - Friday, Nov 2nd, 2018\nAdded new Yelp fields:\n- Added string Id to the Review object.\n- Added string[] PossibleLanguages to the ReviewResponse object.\n- Added string Id and string ProfileUrl to the User object.\n\n1.4.3 - Wednesday, Oct 3rd, 2018\nRemoved extra DLLs that would show up in projects that used this NuGet package.\n\n1.4.2 - Tuesday, Oct 2nd, 2018\n[Deleted] This was supposed to fix the extra DLLs but didn't.  Removed because it didn't provide anything new beyond 1.4.1.\n\n1.4.1 - Monday, Oct 1st, 2018\nYelp has made the field that was previously known as Id, now a Business's Alias.  Id is now a unique, generated string that is machine readable, where Alias is the unique human readable, hypen-separated business name.  Alias has now been added to BusinessResponse and the GraphQL data.\n\n1.4.0 - Tuesday, Sept 25th, 2018\n- Fixed multithreading for GetBusinessAsyncInParallel and GetGraphQlInChunksAsyncInParallel so they actually send calls in parallel.  Consumer can also set how many threads they use, default is 2.\n- Fixed GetGraphQlInChunksAsync so it actually makes calls in series as intended.\n- Increased default size of businesses sent through GraphQl calls from 5 to 25 due to improvements to the Yelp API.  This can also be changed by the consumer.\n- Calls to Yelp API now have mechanics to automatically retry if they fail due to endpoint flooding.  Use the ConnectionRetrySettings class to change these settings.\n- This package will now throw AccessLimitExceptions if Yelp returns ACCESS_LIMIT_REACHED (for when you go over your daily amount of calls allowed).\n- General clean up and bug fixes.\n- Enhancements, clarifications, and fixes to the Example project.\n\n1.3.4 - Tuesday, Sept 11th, 2018\nPull latest changes from base project so Yelp Authentication works again.  Minor example project clean up.\n\n1.3.3 - Thursday, July 27th, 2017\nFix bug that was making GraphQL calls with wrong Content-Type.  Updates to Yelp.Api require Content-Type: application/graphql now when making GraphQL calls.\n\n1.3.2 - Friday, July 15th, 2017\nFix bug when converting businesses that have null coordinates from Yelp.\n\n1.3.1 - Monday, June 19, 2017\nAdded IsSpecialFlag to BusinessResponse model. (Removed in v1.3.4)\n\n1.3.0 - Monday, June 19, 2017\nFirst release as a Web version of Yelp.Api.",
