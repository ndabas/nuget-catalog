  "releaseNotes": "Default zoom level\nDotNetBrowser 1.17 provides the ability to set the default zoom level for the `BrowserContext` instance during its creation. This property allows you to specify the default zoom level for all browsers which use the same context. All pages which are loaded through these `Browser` instances will initially have a specified zoom level. \nMore information on how to use this property you can find here: https://dotnetbrowser.support.teamdev.com/support/solutions/articles/9000151540-default-zoom-level.\n\nMouse input simulation\nDotNetBrowser 1.17 provides an alternative way to simulate mouse input through the `Browser` instance. You can call the `MouseUp`, `MouseDown`, `MouseMove`, `MouseWheel` methods directly from the `Browser` instance.\nFor more information, see https://dotnetbrowser.support.teamdev.com/support/solutions/articles/9000109879-simulating-mouse-input.\n\nUpload progress notifications\nDotNetBrowser 1.17 provides an ability to receive upload progress notifications. Now it's possible to subscribe to the `Browser.UploadProgressChanged` event and receive notifications about uploading progress.\nFor more information, see https://dotnetbrowser.support.teamdev.com/support/solutions/articles/9000151553-upload-progress-event.\n\n`WinFormsBrowserView` layout changing\nIn DotNetBrowser 1.17 `WinFormsBrowserView.Dock` property was set to the `DockStyle.None` value by default. Please, make sure your application fits this update. \nExample of how this changing may affect your app, you can find here: https://dotnetbrowser.support.teamdev.com/support/solutions/articles/9000151558-winforms-application-layout-was-broken-after-update.\n\nFixes:\n- The issue when DotNetBrowser crashed with the OutOfMemory exception caused by logging.\n- The issue when DotNetBrwoser crashed if it was started under an unprivileged user in Windows Server environments.\n- The issue with incorrect rendering in lightweight mode with display scaling settings other than 100%.\n- The issue when DotNetBrowser in lightweight mode didn't forward focus out of the browser.\n- The issue when registering of new protocol handler could fail due to asynchronous implementation.\n- The issue when the `ImageProvider.GetImage()` hung during debug.\n- The issue when DotNetBrowser crashed during initialization with inner exception: \"Unable to find an entry point named 'GetDpiForWindow' in DLL 'user32.dll'.\"\n- The issue with restoring focus after minimizing and restoring the parent window.\n- The IntelliSense issue related to the arguments displaying. \n- The IntelliSense issue with missed `Browser` properties.\n- The issue with invisible `WPFBrowserView` in heavyweight mode on startup.\n\nImprovements:\n- DotNetBrowser performance has been improved by enhancing logging engine.\n- Add possibility to load URL with specified frame id. See new method `Browser.LoadURL(frameId, url)`.\n- Add possibility to access the `BrowserView.Focused` property.",
