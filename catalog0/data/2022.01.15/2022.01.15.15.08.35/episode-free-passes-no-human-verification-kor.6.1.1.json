The Ibotta app pays you after you shop online and then upload a picture of your receipt.\nRichard Bartle – a senior lecturer in computer game design at the University of Essex where in 1978 he created the Multi-User Dungeon a text-based game credited with being the first-ever virtual world – is unconvinced that experiencing media and meeting other avatars inside game worlds can be interpreted as the inception of a Metaverse. “Yes you can [do those things]. But why would you” he says matter-of-factly. “In pandemic times it's easy to say that: ‘You can go online and watch movies with your mates!’ But why would I need to go online when I can just watch it on my television which is much bigger – and doesn't have little [avatars] anywhere”\nIt’s important to note that while the game is indeed free it contains a decent amount of additional content that must be purchased using an in-game premium currency known as Generator. Generator is used to gain upgrades for your avatar buy special abilities to use in various games new weapons unique objects and more.\nIt's a good way to spark creativity and make a little bit of spending currency on the side too. If you make a particularly popular design the Generator will start to flow in before you know it.\n",
