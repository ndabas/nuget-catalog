  "description": "Logger lets an application write output to a text file, the console, a message box, or a method on a user-provided assembly. This assembly can provide other forms of logging such as writing to a database or sending e-mail. The application specifies the events to log and the information to include with these events. A configuration XML file specifies the type of output to be associated with each event, and the formatting for the information included with the event.\n\nYou can find a sample project that shows how to use Logger at the following URL.\nhttps://sourceforge.net/projects/xlogger/files/Logger_Sample_Source/",
