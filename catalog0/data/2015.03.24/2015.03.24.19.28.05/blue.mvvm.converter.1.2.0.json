Feel free to delete this file when you familiarized with the usage. However, donÂ´t extend this file, as this may be updated in future releases, until the corresponding \"sample\" pacakge is available\n\n\n      _what to expect in future releases?_\n\n      There are many ideas around regarding upcoming releases of the Blue.MVVM suite.\n      However, those updates will be shipped in form of additional packages. This way, you can add just those packages that best fits your application and needs.\n\n      Upcoming releases may include, but are not limited to:\n      + XML-comments\n      - packages with samples\n      - (fluid)validation\n      - message broker\n      - IoC-Container integration\n      - public git-repo\n      - many more...\n\n      So stay tuned for updates!\n\n\n      Send feedback, feature-request, unexpected breaking changes, etc. via the projects nuget-page, http://www.nuget.org/packages/Blue.MVVM.Converter/ContactOwners, until there is a projet homepage...",
