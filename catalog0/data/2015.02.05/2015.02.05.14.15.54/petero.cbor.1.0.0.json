  "description": "A C# implementation of Concise Binary Object Representation, a general-purpose binary data format defined in RFC 7049. According to that RFC, CBOR's data model \"is an extended version of the JSON data model\", supporting many more types of data than JSON. This implementation was written by Peter O. and is released to the Public Domain under the CC0 Declaration.\n    This implementation also doubles as a reader and writer of JSON, and can convert data from JSON to CBOR and back.\n    Finally, this implementation supports arbitrary-precision binary and decimal floating-point numbers and rational numbers with arbitrary-precision components, and supports arithmetic with these numbers.",

  "releaseNotes": "In version 1.0, the \"adjust exponent\" and \"is precision in bits\" flags were added to the arbitrary-precision arithmetic contexts, and a new Set method that is similar to Add but can replace a key's value in a CBOR map. Some bugs were also fixed.\n    See the project page for release notes on previous versions: https://github.com/peteroupc/CBOR",
