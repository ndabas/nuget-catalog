These creation tools are designed to be less daunting to the entry-level developer than professional game engines and fully customisable frameworks exist across numerous genres. These include maze-runners first-person shooters tycoon simulators and free-form “roleplay” genre where developers create worlds – schools cities historical eras sci-fi dystopias etc – for users to project their own stories onto informed by their interactions with the setting and other users.\nApparently these Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5 version upgrades had been in the works for a while and the game’s recent surge in popularity had actually delayed them as the influx of new players and increased server load took priority.
