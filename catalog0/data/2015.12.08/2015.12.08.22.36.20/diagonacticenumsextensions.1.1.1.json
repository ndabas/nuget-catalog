  "description": "Enums and Delegates are a fundimental component of .Net, however, as of version 6.0 of the C# language, there's no way to (directly) constrain a generic parameter to System.Enum or System.Delegate. There's so many reasons to want to do so, not the least of which is the set of kludgy static methods on Enum and Delegate that would really benefit from generic implementations.\n\nThis package addresses that need.  Written in C++/CLI since C# cannot declare an enum or delegate restriction, this library provides a set of well performing extension and static methods off of the \"Diagonactic.Enums\" class that provide a more readable way of performing common operations on enums and delegates, all of which can be consumed by C# code.\n\nEnum methods are stable, Delegate methods are considered \"Beta\".  As a result, the API for Delegate methods may be modified (Obsolete tags for invalid members will be added if this happens), though every effort will be made to avoid this.  Enum methods are API stable, however, methods are added occasionally.\n\nAll stable methods are unit tested for all underlying types with complete code coverage.\n\nSee release notes and readme.md on the Project site.\n\nIncluded .dll is compiled IL only in \"Any CPU\" format.",
