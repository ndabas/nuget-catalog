  "releaseNotes": "Upgraded to Akka.NET v1.4.10 (use Akka.Monitoring v1.0.0 if you need Akka.NET v1.3 support)\nMigrated all packages to .NET Standard 2.0\nSwitched StatsD component to use [JustEat.StatsD](https://www.nuget.org/packages/JustEat.StatsD/)\nPhobos vs. Akka.Monitoring**\nIn 2018 [Petabridge](https://petabridge.com/), the makers of Akka.Monitoring, [published a propreitary product for Akka.NET monitoring and tracing called Phobos](https://phobos.petabridge.com/).\nPhobos is much more fully-featured than Akka.Monitoring, as it:\n1. Doesn't require users to decorate their actors with any code - monitoring and tracing happens automatically;\n2. Supports a much larger number of metric systems and types out of the box;\n3. Includes traceability with actors, including over the network with Akka.Remote, and other parts of your system such as ASP.NET Core; and\n4. Comes with 1 business day SLA support for Phobos and installing it into your Akka.NET applications.\nThat said, [a Phobos license costs your company $4,000 per year](https://phobos.petabridge.com/articles/setup/request.html).\nIt's the belief of Petabridge that there should be a low-cost alternative to that in order to make Akka.NET accessible to students, startups, DIY developers, and anyone who doesn't want to pay for that license. That's what Akka.Monitoring is - a simple, straightforward alternative that is free and open source. We will continue to support Akka.Monitoring and respond to end-user requests, but you should expect the majority of our development efforts to go into Phobos.\nPlease open an issue or [contact Petabridge](https://petabridge.com/contact/) if you have any questions.",
