  "releaseNotes": "This package contains assemblies for Dynamics 365 (online and on-premises). These assemblies require application development using the Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5.2 or later.\n\n        9.0.2.4:\n            Added support for retrying SDK request if the server throws a retriable errors.\n            ImportSolutionToCrmAsync – \n                Returns an AsyncOperation ID that must be polled for solution Import competition or failure. \n                Note, Async jobs are subject to Async queueing and overhead, thus use this with caution.\n            DeleteAndPromoteSolutionAsync – \n                Returns an AsyncOperation ID that must be polled for competition\n                Note: DeleteAndPromote Async support is not generally available to all regions and versions of the platform.  If this not available the async job with fail immediately.\n                Note: Async jobs are subject to Async queueing and overhead, thus use this with caution.\n            Added support for retrying SDK request if the server throws a retriable errors.\n            Modified Package to include Json.net as a proper nuget reference. \n            Modified logging to report time lost to threading blocks (threading blocks occur when the service client is being used in a multithreaded application) \n\n        9.0.2.3: \n            Added new dependancies: \n                Json.net version 6.0.0.0\n                Microsoft.Rest.ClientRuntime 3.0.0.0\n            Added Support for Caller ID using AAD Object ID of caller -\n                Added new property on CrmServiceClient: CallerAADObjectId\n                Supported for 8.1 and later.\n            Added New Method ExecuteCrmWebRequest\n                This method supports using the XRM WebAPI directly from the CRMServiceClient.\n                Supports only oAuth and Certificate Auth connection types\n                Supported for 8.0 and later. \n                Supports Common request types and supports batch execute.\n            Added Global Discovery Support for Instance lookup \n                Global discovery is now used for all lookup, both regional and global (Online Region = Don't Know) when OAuth is used, except where special region rules are required.\n                Note: Germany and North America 2 are not scanned when Online Region = Don't Know is selected.\n            Added SkipDiscovery to all connection string variants.\n            Added Certificate support for constructor variants. \n            Fixed issue with allowing discovery selection using onPrem and OAuth.\n            Fixed an issue with older On-Prem ADFS instances that do not require a resource URI.\n\n            **Special notes: \n                Added additional telemetry support to connection requests\n                    This will add the process name of the calling process (if available) to help with troubleshooting and support requests.\n                Added request IDs to all requests to help with troubleshooting and support requests.\n                    These will appear only when verbose logging is enabled. \n                \n            \n          9.0.0.7: Fixed to allow External Authentication Type to function in released versions of Xrm.Tooling.Connector.dll\n          9.0.0.5: 9.0 Initial Release\n          9.0.0.2-Preview:\n          Improved cache system for faster reconnects.\n          New interfaces to support certificate based auth.\n          Added support to skip discovery\n          Added Clone connection support of OAuth based connections\n          Added New Authentication type to support externally hosted auth.\n          **Note: Interface for Xrm.Tooling.Connector is *NOT* Final. there are new API interfaces that will be surfaced before GA.\n\n          8.2.0.5:\n          Fix to memory leak in Microsoft.Xrm.Tooling.Connector.TraceLoggerBase.  Trace Listener collection would not be released within a process over a very long time frame over multiple connections. This would manifest as increasing memory consumption over a very long period.\n          Fix cleans this up on the .dispose() call on the CrmServiceClient.\n          Note: if you have built your own logger based on the Microsoft.Xrm.Tooling.Connector.TraceLoggerBase, you must call .dispose() when you are done with it to clean up the listener collection assigned to it.\n\n          8.2.0.4:\n          Added:\n          Added Support for United Kingdom CRM GEO\n\n          Added new behavior to DynamicsFileLogTraceListener.  You can now specify a rolling log behavior based on log size.  To enabled this, add the MaxFileSize key set to the size in bytes and the MaxFileCount set to the max number of files to the Microsoft.Xrm.Tooling.Connector.DynamicsFileLogTraceListener in your app.config.\n\n          8.2.0.2: Fix of dependency issue in nuget package. Now properly requires .net 4.5.2 as a baseline\n          8.2.0.1: Assembly version changed to 2.2.0.0\n          Fixes:\n          Connection String support:\n          Corrected issues with connection string login to properly support the \"never prompt\" behavior.\n          Corrected issue were the connector would create a new instance of the connection unnecessarily – impacted ONLY connection string process.\n          RequireNewInstance=True will now properly create a unique connection instance, RequireNewInstance = false, will now properly reuse the cached instance of the connection,  default is ‘false’\n\n          Streamlined re-use of existing connection code when a new instance is called for by a constructor to remove unnecessary calls.\n          Modified Caching support to return the full object from in memory cache vs just the core connection.\n          Fixed token cache behavior to work properly when assembly is resident on an Azure WebApp or Function.\n          Fixed ADAL nuget dependency issue to allow assembly to consumed directly from nuget into an Azure function.\n          Fixed MFA ( multifactor authentication ) to properly handle password expired, and password to MFA scenarios\n\n          Added:\n          New Function Utility.GetOrgnameAndOnlineRegionFromServiceUri, Used to parse a Org URL for the correct online region and org name.\n          CrmServiceClient now implements IDisposable to allow for the object to be explicitly disposed.\n\n          8.1.0.1: Updated to a newer version of Microsoft.IdentityModel.Clients.ActiveDirectory as required by the Xrm Tooling assemblies\n          8.1.0: CRM Online 2016 Update 1\n          8.1-preview: Pre-release CRM Online 2016 Update 1\n          8.0.2: UR1 (Update Rollup 1)\n          8.0.0: RTM",
