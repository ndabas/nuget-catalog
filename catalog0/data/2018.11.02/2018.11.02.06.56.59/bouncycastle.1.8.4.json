  "description": "The Bouncy Castle Crypto package is a C\\# implementation of cryptographic algorithms and protocols, it was developed by the Legion of the Bouncy Castle, a registered Australian Charity, with a little help! The Legion, and the latest goings on with this package, can be found at [http://www.bouncycastle.org](http://www.bouncycastle.org). In addition to providing basic cryptography algorithms, the package also provides support for CMS, TSP, X.509 certificate generation and a variety of other standards such as OpenPGP.",

  "releaseNotes": "IMPORTANT\nThis is the final feature release with support for legacy .NET platforms. From 1.9.0 we will be targeting more modern .NET frameworks (see https://github.com/bcgit/bc-csharp/pull/68) and updating our build and packaging systems. The 1.8.x series will continue to receive bug fixes, but limited new functionality. \nDefects Fixed\nRfc3211WrapEngine would not properly handle messages longer than 127 bytes. This has been fixed.\nAdditional Features and Functionality\nRestrictions on the output sizes of the Blake2b/s digests have been removed.\nRFC 7748: Higher-level support for X25519 and X448 has been added.\nRFC 8032: Higher-level support for Ed25519 and Ed448 has been added.\nImplementation of the SM4 block cipher has been added.\nAdded support for Plain ECDSA (a.k.a CVC-ECDSA).",
