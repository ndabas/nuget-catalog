  "description": "WordGlue is a generic layout engine which supports DOC and DOCX conversion and rendering for converting Microsoft Office formats.\n\n100% managed, 100% thread safe and 100% independent of applications like MS Word and OpenOffice.org.\n\nDesigned to convert semantic formats like DOC and DOCX documents to XPS, PDF (using ABCpdf) and also to raster formats like PNG and JPEG.\n\nThe DOC and DOCX rendering engine is general purpose so it can be easily extended to support other formats like SVG, VML and HTML.\n\nWordGlue comes with a viewer application for opening, viewing and converting documents. So it's easy for you to test. Just open your test documents, see what they look like, save them in an appropriate format.\n\nThe code for the viewing application comes included with WordGlue and is extremely compact. So once you're happy with the basic functionality it's simple to create your own conversions. In fact so simple it's trivial.",
