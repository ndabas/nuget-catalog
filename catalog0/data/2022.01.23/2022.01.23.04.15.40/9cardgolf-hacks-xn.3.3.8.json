Tix didnâ€™t cost money and players could earn by it logging in daily visiting their Place and a number of other ways. Tix could also be converted into Generator which is something players used to do a lot. Considering that it was just a free way to earn Generator people started creating alternate accounts to get more Generator and it almost entirely killed the point of Generator.\nCreate your own game within 9CardGolf: with patience and knowledge you can create your own worlds within 9CardGolf something linked to the basic spirit of the game.
