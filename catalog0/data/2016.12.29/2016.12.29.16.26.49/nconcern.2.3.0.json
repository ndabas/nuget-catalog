  "description": "NConcern is a .NET efficient runtime AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming) framework for .NET 4.0+ written in C# that reduces tangling caused by cross-cutting concerns with a minimum cost to maximize quality and productivity. It is based on method swaping and provide an efficient way to produce (delegate, linq expression & ILGenerator) and factorize transversal source code.\n\n- non-intrusive : no need to change the source code or the publishing process.\n- friendly : delegates, expressions (linq) or CIL (ILGenerator) can be used to define an aspect\n- no configuration : additional configuration files are not required\n- no proxy : decoration by inheritance and factory pattern are not required\n- low learning curve : get started under 20 minutes\n- no installer : single .net library (.dll) to reference\n- suited for unit testing : weaving is controlled at runtime\n- low performance overhead : injection mechanic is built to be efficient\n- limitless : everything except generic methods is supported (coming with next release)\n- runtime lifecycle : aspect can be updated/created/removed at runtime",
