  "description": "Limerick team named to play Longford in Saturday's Allianz Football League round one tie\n\n\nLive Here ==> https://enamul27-35.blogspot.com/2022/01/gaa.html\n\nLive Here ==> https://enamul27-35.blogspot.com/2022/01/gaa.html\n\n\n\nTHE Limerick senior football team has been named for Saturday's opening round tie in the Allianz Football League.\n\nBilly Lee's Shannonsiders entertain Longford at 5pm in the TUS Gaelic Grounds this January 29 in the first of seven Division Three games.\n\nNine of the team started the Munster SFC semi final against Cork last season - with another two of that team listed among the subs against the Leinster side.\n\nIndeed of the starting 15 to play Longford, all bar two played some part in Limerick's Munster Championship last season - Jim Liston and Padraig de Brun.\n\nWing back Gordon Brown misses out injured, while three of last year's championship line-up have opted out of the panel this season.\n\nFour of the substitutes - Aaron O'Sullivan, Diarmaid Kelly, Liam Kennedy and Dara Noonan are yet to play in the Allianz League. O'Sullivan has played championship football though - replacing the injured Donal O'Sullivan in goals against Cork in the Munster SFC last July.\n\nSaturday will be the first league meeting of the teams since 2016 when Longford were 0-13 to 1-8 winners in Pearse Park in a season in which Limerick were relegated - Donal O'Sullivan, Sean O'Dea, Iain Corbett, Darragh Tracey, Cian Sheehan and Peter Nash remain in situ from that starting team.\n\nThe Longford senior football team has been named to play Limerick in the opening round fixture in Division 3 of the National League at the TUS Gaelic Grounds this Saturday evening, throw-in 5pm. \n\nWhile Darren Gallagher is apparently an injury doubt, he has been selected at midfield while also listed in the first fifteen are newcomers Aaron Farrell from Dromard and Killoe duo James Moran and Ryan Moffett.",
