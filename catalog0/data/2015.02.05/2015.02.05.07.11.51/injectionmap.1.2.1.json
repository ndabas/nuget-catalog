  "description": "InjectionMap is a very small and extremely lightweight IoC/DI container for .NET.  \nInjectionMap allows loose coupling betweeen a client's dependencies and its own behaviour. InjectionMap promotes reusability, testability and maintainability of any part of an application.\n\n- InjectionMap uses type mapping to reference the key/reference and the implementation. \n- Instances are resolved using reflection or can be provided through a callback whitch allows you to create the instance in your own code.\n- It suports a fluent syntax to help keep the code simple, small and clean.\n- Injection constructors can be marked with attributes.\n- Parameters for constructors can be injected or passed at the time of mapping or as expressions.\n- InjectionMap is very simple and straightforward.\n\nBugs, issues or feature wishes can submitted on https://github.com/InjectionMap/InjectionMap on the issues page or feel free to fork the project and send a pull request.",
