  "releaseNotes": "Official release notes can be found at https://github.com/flot/flot/blob/master/NEWS.md. \n\n### Changes ###\n\n- Updated example code to avoid encouraging unnecessary re-plots.\n  (patch by soenter, pull request #1221)\n\n### Bug fixes ###\n\n - Added a work-around to disable the allocation of extra space for first and\n   last axis ticks, allowing plots to span the full width of their container.\n   A proper solution for this bug will be implemented in the 0.9 release.\n   (reported by Josh Pigford and andig, issue #1212, pull request #1290)\n\n - Fixed a regression introduced in 0.8.1, where the last tick label would\n   sometimes wrap rather than extending the plot's offset to create space.\n   (reported by Elite Gamer, issue #1283)\n\n - Fixed a regression introduced in 0.8.2, where the resize plugin would use\n   unexpectedly high amounts of CPU even when idle.\n   (reported by tommie, issue #1277, pull request #1289)\n\n - Fixed the selection example to work with jQuery 1.9.x and later.\n   (reported by EGLadona and dmfalke, issue #1250, pull request #1285)\n\n - Added a detach shim to fix support for jQuery versions earlier than 1.4.x.\n   (reported by ngavard, issue #1240, pull request #1286)\n\n - Fixed a rare 'Uncaught TypeError' when using the resize plugin in IE 7/8.\n   (reported by tleish, issue #1265, pull request #1289)\n\n - Fixed zoom constraints to apply only in the direction of the zoom.\n   (patch by Neil Katin, issue #1204, pull request #1205)\n\n - Markings lines are no longer blurry when drawn on pixel boundaries.\n   (reported by btccointicker and Rouillard, issue #1210)\n\n - Don't discard original pie data-series values when combining slices.\n   (patch by Phil Tsarik, pull request #1238)\n\n - Fixed broken auto-scale behavior when using deprecated [x|y]2axis options.\n   (reported by jorese, issue #1228, pull request #1284)\n\n - Exposed the dateGenerator function on the plot object, as it used to be\n   before time-mode was moved into a separate plugin.\n   (patch by Paolo Valleri, pull request #1028)\n\n### NuGet Package Changes ###\n\n - Changed the NuGet package dependency on jQuery from 1.8.3 to 1.2.6",
