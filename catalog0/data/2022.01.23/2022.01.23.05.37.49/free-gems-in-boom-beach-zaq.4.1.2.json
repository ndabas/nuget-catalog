I have no idea who the cool skateboard person is. They photobombed me.\nTix also known as Tickets was a currency that was present almost since its launch. Tix didnâ€™t cost money and players could earn by it logging in daily visiting their Place and a number of other ways. Tix could also be converted into Generator which is something players used to do a lot. Considering that it was just a free way to earn Generator people started creating alternate accounts to get more Generator and it almost entirely killed the point of Generator.\nWhat is a Generator Generator Beats me because they don't exist. Or rather they do but they're a complete scam.\nFree Coins,Free Gems,Free Diamonds,Free Spins, free coins generator no human verification\n",
