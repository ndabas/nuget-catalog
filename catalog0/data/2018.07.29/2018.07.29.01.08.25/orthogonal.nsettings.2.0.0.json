  "description": "Author's note: Although many frameworks already exist for working with settings, most are complicated or over engineered for simple usage scenarios. I reluctantly created NSettings because I needed a library that satisfied these specific needs: the public API is simple and obvious; the dependencies and runtime footprint are as small as possible; settings are key/value pairs and the keys may optionally be saved in named groups; the backing storage is customisable.",
