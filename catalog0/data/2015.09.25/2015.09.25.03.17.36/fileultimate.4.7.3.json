  "releaseNotes": "Version 4.7.3 - September 24, 2015\n- Added: The public method ControlContext.RegisterRoutes for being able to re-insert FileUltimate related routes \n  in case you clear the routes via RouteTable.Routes.Clear() at some point in your application.\n- Improved: The way some native DLLs are loaded so the below problem which still happens on some rare machines may be \n  fixed:\n\t\n\tIntermittent w3wp.exe crashes related to bxsdk32.dll or bxsdk64.dll, in Windows Event Viewer an error similar to \n\tbelow was being\tlogged:\n\n\tFaulting application name: w3wp.exe, version: 8.0.9200.16384, time stamp: 0x5010885f\n\tFaulting module name: bxsdk32.dll, version: 3.3.5.24, time stamp: 0x55803b90\n\tException code: 0xc0000005\n  \n  Note that if you still get this error after this version, you can use this undocumented setting in your web.config:\n\n\t  <configuration>\n\t\t<appSettings>\n\t\t  <add key=\"FileUltimate:DisableVideoThumbnails\" value=\"1\" />\n\t\t</appSettings>\n\t  </configuration>\n\n  This setting will disable generating thumbnails for video files only (image files are not effected) so that you can \n  avoid this error altogether by sacrificing only the related feature.",
