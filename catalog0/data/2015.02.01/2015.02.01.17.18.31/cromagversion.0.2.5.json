  "description": "An MSBuild project integration that makes it easy to keep version numbers synced across all projects in a solution based on a simple date scheme and user provided major / minor version numbers.  Provides a single source of truth for versioning, and modifies it at build time as necessary to keep assembly metadata fresh.",

  "releaseNotes": "* Removed MSBuild-y ness from version.props since its extraneous and confuses things (breaking change)\n        * Added ability to override FileVersion and AssemblyInformationalVersion versions with a custom layout given a few well known variables\n        * Able to find AssemblyInfo.cs in locations other than Properties folder\n        * Using BeforeTargets=\"CoreCompile\" instead of BeforeTargets=\"Build\"\n        * Renamed Lines ItemGroup internally to AssemblyInfoLines to prevent possible collisions with other global MSBuild variables\n        * Renamed Version target to CroMagVersion target to prevent possible MSBuild collisions\n        * CroMagVersion now registered as a dependency via BuildDependsOn and RebuildDependsOn",
