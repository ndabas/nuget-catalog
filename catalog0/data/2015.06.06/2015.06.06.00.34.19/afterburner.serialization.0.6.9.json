  "description": "FYI: 64bit only for now\nThis prerelease version contains an optimized serializer serializing:\n• Value Types\n• Strings\n• System.Collections (most types)\n• System.Collections.Generic(most types)\n• Types implementing IEnumerable.\n\nAll versions have the optimized serializer core and specific optimizations for many types in place. Versions 0.8.0 and higher will have specific optimizations for all System.Collections.* and primitive types targeted in 1.0 release in place. Versions 0.9.0 and higher will include an optimized deserializer. Versions below this level will include a version of Mehdi Gholam's fastJson deserializer. The 1.0.0 milestone will include .NETs highest performance serializer/deserializer and the full initial set of configurable settings. Future versions to include more configuration/customization options and dynamic support.",

Additionally some of the configuration settings have been made available as they appear to be stable now. This includes the BuffersToPlaid flag that will give your serializers and additonal speed boost.",
