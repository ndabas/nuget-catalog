  "description": "Build a Responsive Web Site Your Way\n\nDecide the number of columns you want in a row & set the margin you want to use. Some sweet maths will do the heavy lifting for you.\n\nHave Any Number of Columns\nDon't be forced into having a fixed number of columns across a whole page. You can have whatever you want, wherever you need it.\n\nScales to Any Width\nBecause it uses percentages, your fluid columns will fit into any width. The margins (gutters) use percentages too.\n\nIt's Smart\nThere's no need to hack in any offsets or marginless final columns. It's the last time you need to use .last and the end of .end.\n\nPut the Content First\nInstead of fitting your content to your grid, you can make your grid suit your content. Doesn't that feel good?\n\nIt Fits In with You\nIt plugs into your existing HTML and CSS, and it's so easy to do so. It's your friend.\n\nSimple Breakpoints\nMobile versions of the grid are already baked in, or you can cook up your own.\n\nt's Easy\nUse it on as simple or as complex a project as you wish. You'll be done in minutes.\n\nNo Maths Required\nAs long as you can count up to the number of columns you need, you'll be fine.",
