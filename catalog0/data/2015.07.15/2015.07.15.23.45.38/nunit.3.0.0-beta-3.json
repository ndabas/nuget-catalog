  "description": "NUnit features a fluent assert syntax, parameterized, generic and theory tests and is user-extensible. A number of runners, both from the NUnit project and by third parties, are able to execute NUnit tests.\n\nThis package includes the NUnit 3.0 framework assembly, which is referenced by your tests. You will need to install version 3.0 of the nunit-console program or a third-party runner that supports NUnit 3.0 in order to execute tests. Runners intended for use with NUnit 2.x will not run 3.0 tests correctly.\n\nThis is an beta release, but is ready for production use for people with prior NUnit experience.",
