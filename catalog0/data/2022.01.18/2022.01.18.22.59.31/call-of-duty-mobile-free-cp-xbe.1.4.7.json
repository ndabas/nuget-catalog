After languishing for two years Splitgate found major success recently. The free-to-play game has been downloaded more than two million times so far and has received almost universal acclaim. Now there is more good news for Splitgate fans on console as the studio has announced the game will have its own upgraded version for current-gen consoles.\nWe cannot share the images because Activision is issuing copyright takedown notices to anyone directly hosting them. If you’re curious about the cover art this is still currently available via Reddit and Imgur. This artwork doesn’t confirm much other than the World War 2 setting. It’s also very clear from these images that there will be as expected several editions of the game including cross-gen bundles.\nThere are also lots of game-specific scams out there especially in the bigger games such as Adopt Me. All of the major games do their best to combat scammers but the key thing to learn here is that if something seems too good to be true then it probably is and should be avoided. Make sure you educate your kids about scammers and they should remain safe and happy.\n",
