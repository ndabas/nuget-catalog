  "description": "Traditional simple text base logging frameworks lack what your application can easily emit in providing you better insight into the health of your application. Wouldn’t it be great to easily instrument incredible rich details? Well, look no further. ReflectInsight was designed to easily let your application speak volumes!\n\nOne of ReflectInsight’s most powerful features is its impressive and elegant Viewer. The Viewer was design to hone in on particular issues and filter any unwanted noise by creating User Defined Views. User Defined Views allow you to filter a given request and visualize the execution path that actually caused the issue at hand. \n\nEveryone knows that debugging multithread applications is no simple task. Due to racing conditions, traditional IDE debuggers are not well suited for the job and don’t really provide an accurate picture behind the scenes. With ReflectInsight’s Live Viewer, debugging multithread applications is that much easier!\n\nIn order to use this library you must have the ReflectInsight Viewer installed. Download and install the ReflectInsight Viewer from this location: \n\nhttp://www.ReflectSoftware.com/Public/Download.aspx\n\nYou can view your messages in realtime, in a rich viewer that allows you to filter out and search for what really matters to you.",
