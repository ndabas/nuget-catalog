  "description": "Hi everyone! Know the information about some gem generator Clash RoyaleLet's see if they really work or if their use could harm you much more than it could help you.\n\nClick Here To Get Access: https://gamecodeclaim.com/c/clashroyale/\n\nClick Here To Get Access: https://gamecodeclaim.com/c/clashroyale/\n\n\nGenerators of gems, or cards, and even coins, are very popular, but real, real that is said, they are not, and why we say this, because people continue to believe that gems will appear in their accounts by art of Magic.\n\nGem generators are nothing more than a waste of time, which you submit to when you go around believing that someone is going to give you resources just for the sake of it.\n\nIf they are to work, they would be highly damaging, because they could make Clash Royale it will ban your account, because Supercell is very attentive to player accounts, and a sudden change in which they add an exorbitant amount of gems would be striking.\n\nWe do not recommend cheating in this or in any other game, even if you have the possibility to do so, it is a mistake, because the only thing you do is put your effort into play.\n\nWe also want to remind you about Supercell's Fair Play policies that establish that the use of third-party applications, hacks, and everything related to this area would be punished with an important sanction such as the temporary or permanent suspension of your account.",
