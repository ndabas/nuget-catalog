If you don’t want to pay for Generator there are actually other options to earn the currency that are outlined by the developers on the official website.\nDecentraland is another Metaverse candidate that grapples with this very issue. Dave Carr of the Decentraland Foundation tells me that the founders decided that “rather than have these environments be controlled by central bodies they should have a decentralised structure and be open to everyone to own and govern.” From economic matters to content moderation and even the maintenance of its servers Decentraland’s user base dictates its entire policy course through regular votes.\nMany people enjoy playing games on Keyboard Art and with over 70 million monthly active players there is a good chance that you are one of them.
