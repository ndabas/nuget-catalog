  "description": "MvcCodeRouting for ASP.NET MVC analyzes your controllers and actions and automatically creates the best possible routes for them.\n         Organize your controllers and views using namespaces (no more areas) that can go as deep as you want.\n         Includes support for hierarchical (a.k.a. RESTful) and also user-defined custom routes (using an attribute).\n         It also supports embedded views (as assembly resources) that can be individually overriden by file views.\n         MvcCodeRouting is a single unified solution that provides namespace-aware automatic route creation, URL generation and views location.",

  "releaseNotes": "- Added CodeRoutingSettings constructor that takes another CodeRoutingSettings instance to copy the settings from.\n         - Added TokenName property to FromRouteAttribute.\n         - CodeRoutingConstraint parameter name renamed to __routecontext.\n         - Ambiguous route check now done on actions just created and not all registered actions. This allows you to override routes.\n         - Added UseImplicitIdToken setting, useful for existing applications that only use a generic {controller}/{action}/{id} route.\n         - Case-only constraint on action segment formatting removed, now SomeAction can be formatted as Some-Action, or some_action, etc.\n\n         Breaking changes:\n         - ~controller syntax now matches routes in the same baseRoute.",
