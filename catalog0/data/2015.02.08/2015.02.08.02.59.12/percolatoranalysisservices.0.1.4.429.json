  "releaseNotes": "Finally, a way to query a Microsoft SQL Server Analysis Database with LINQ and type safe objects! \n\nBeta version - Comes without any warranties.  Please contact me via the \"Contact Owners\" link for any questions, comments, bugs, or features you think should be included. Any response to this package is greatly appreciated.  Make sure to read the \"Documentation\" text file that is included with the package. \n\nChanges: \n-Fixed an issue where creating a new Member using hierarchy levels would yield an empty member.\n\n- Fixed an issue where the PAS syntax was just flat out not working.\n    *Note -> there is still a small issue with how the cube property reference returns a new cube reference every time it's used.  To fix it yourself, change the generator.ttinclude file to set each Cube<> property in the main database class to be instantiated in the constructor, rather than in the get accessor.  Otherwise, the next update will have the proper change.\n\n- Fixed an issue with a sub cube using linq is not property translating, resulting in empty results being returned from the query.\n\nComing Changes:\n-Changing the generator to only generate each dimension once, and sharing them among their respective cube classes.",
