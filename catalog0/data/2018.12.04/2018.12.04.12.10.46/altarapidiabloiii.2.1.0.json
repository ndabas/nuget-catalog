  "releaseNotes": "2.1.0 :\n- Fixed a bug preventing the D3Cache's property ImageAsDirect from functioning as intended;\n- Added an optional property to D3Cache, named ImagesLocation, which allow you to choose where the images are stored;\n- Fixed the cache initialization to properly recreate deleted directory;\n- The images' directory is now recreated while running if it was manually deleted;\n- Added a method overload for GetImagePath, now allowing you to obtain SKILLS icons, small or large, for ActiveSkill, PassiveSkill and FollowerSkill;\n- Items obtained via GetFullItem can now also be used in the GetImagePath method to obtain their icons;\n\n2.0.1 :\n- This is a mostly complete rewrite of the library;\n- I cleaned up the parsing of the data we get from Blizzard into a proper deserialization system;\n- The \"Get\"s methods (i.e. GetCareer, GetFullHero, GetFullItem, etc) are now located directly in the D3Cache class;\n- More thread-safety added;\n- The Clear() method of D3Cache is now more thorought -- it also clear the in-memory cache;\n- More robust -- The library shouldn't normally crash due to minimal changes on Blizzard's part;\n- Faster -- Some optimizations has been done across the board;\n- ATTENTION : I expect minor bugs to crop up, like deserialization mismatches. If you find any, please send me an Email ASAP, i'll be very grateful !\n\n1.3.2 : A small fix for a bug that came with D3's 2.0.1 patch, which prevented the obtention of a career. More to come once the api is updated for the expansion.",
