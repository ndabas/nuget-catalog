  "description": "Fully asynchronous Redis client, capable of pipelined operations; this acts as a multiplexer, allowing high-performance parallel usage of a single connection (or few connections) without being blocked on each separate request. All core redis opeations are supported. This library can also be used from C# 5.0/async very effectively.",

  "releaseNotes": "IMPORTANT: BookSleeve is now succeeded by StackExchange.Redis, which takes the same concept and performance aims, but offers much better support for multiple nodes, availability, etc; sadly, there was no way to reconcile this with the API.\n\n* 1.3.41  - Add: SCAN support (2.8+)\n      * 1.3.40  - Add: slowlog support; save/bgsave/lastsave support\n      * 1.3.39  - Add: ExtendLock / ReleaseLock (now has overload that checks value)\n      * 1.3.38  - Add: DEBUG OBJECT... yess, I know this is not recommended for general usage\n      * 1.3.37  - Fix: Client name not being sent on recent redis-server versions (due to \"info\" detection)\n      * 1.3.36  - Fix: (critical) TakeLock not passing db correctly\n      * 1.3.35  - Fix: bug when validating multiple exists/not-exists conditions in a transaction\n      * 1.3.34  - Fix: raise shutdown/closure events in more scenarios\n      * 1.3.33  - Fix: And... back to the newer async API (and fix error in keep-alive counter)\n      * 1.3.32  - Add: show connection state and other info in counters\n      * 1.3.31  - Fix: ensure transaction abort due to precondition-fail always cancels the unsent messages; use appropriate threads for their callbacks\n      * 1.3.30  - Fix: use ConnectAsync rather than a task with sync Connect\n      * 1.3.29  - Fix: better SocketError tracking with older async read API\n      * 1.3.28  - Add: Make last command time available to the caller; use the older async read API\n      * 1.3.27  - Add: GetCounters tracks the number of in-progress callbacks (sync and async)\n      * 1.3.26  - Fix: Tidying up shutdown\n      * 1.3.25  - Fix: Async-receive could misreport blame\n      * 1.3.24  - Add: Much better tracking of who to blame for shutdown events; this is available on the connection and used in error messages\n      * 1.3.23  - Add: Expose an explicit Shutdown event\n      * 1.3.22  - Add: Make CompletionMode configurable (globally and per-connection)\n      * 1.3.21  - Add: SuspendFlush/ResumeFlush\n      * 1.3.20  - Add: support for DUMP/RESTORE\n      * 1.3.19  - Add: support for batches; like transactions, but no guarantee of atomicity\n      * 1.3.18  - Fix: close during \"shutdown\" was losing fault information\n      * 1.3.17  - Fix: annoying null-ref is annoying\n      * 1.3.16  - Fix: cleanup a few more unobserved exceptions\n      * 1.3.15  - Fix: ensure all exceptions are \"observed\"\n      * 1.3.14  - Fix: treat unsendable messages as cancelled\n      * 1.3.13  - Fix: multi-channel subscribe was failing\n      *         - Add: support for single-command locking w/ 2.6.12 or above\n      * 1.3.12  - Fix: 1.3.11 was deploy fail :(\n      * 1.3.11  - Fix: Environment.Ticks (from 1.3.7) simplified\n      *           Add: Optionally inline callbacks when possible to reduce Task overhead\n      * 1.3.10  - Fix: subscription connections may need to defer pending queue until after INFO, to\n      *           ensure CLIENT SETNAME works; QUIT should not error during Dispose();\n      * 1.3.9   - Add: \"redis-command\" to errors\n      * 1.3.8   - Fix: possible null-ref during timeouts\n      * 1.3.7   - Fix slow ConnectionUtils.Connect performance w/ 'down' servers\n      *         - Avoid Environment.Ticks due to wrap-around\n      * 1.3.6   - Adds TIME support\n      *         - Pub/sub now returns Task to allow tracking of subscription\n      *\n      * 1.3.*- MAJOR CHANGES; 1.3 removes the threaded core to allow for more scalability over multiple connections;\n      *           This is an API-breaking change (especially around pub/sub), and local validation is recommended\n      *\n      * 1.2.0.8 - Fix processing of info=>redis_version to work with MS alpha redis\n      * 1.2.0.7 - Client names now fully supported on 2.6.9+\n      * 1.2.0.6 - Support client names on connections (in theory; API changes only)\n      * 1.2.0.5 - Bug-fixes: large integer parsing\n      * 1.2.0.4 - ConnectionUtils now supports sentinel\n      * 1.2.0.3 - show current tie-breaker key in ConnectionUtils\n      * 1.2.0.2 - added additional ConnectionUtils overloads to control master/slave behavior more granularly\n      * 1.2.0.1 - adds SORT support (under Keys)\n      * 1.2.0.0 - BREAKING CHANGE: SortedSets.{Rank|Score} now return nullable values\n      *         - adds bindings for redis 2.6 commands\n      *         - now strong-named\n      *         - cumulative bug-fixes",
