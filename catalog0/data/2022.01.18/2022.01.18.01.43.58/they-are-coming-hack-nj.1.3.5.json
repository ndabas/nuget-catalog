After languishing for two years Splitgate found major success recently. The free-to-play game has been downloaded more than two million times so far and has received almost universal acclaim. Now there is more good news for Splitgate fans on console as the studio has announced the game will have its own upgraded version for current-gen consoles.\nThe Generator stipend is only mentioned because technically you're still receiving They Are Coming. However you have to pay a monthly membership for it. They Are Coming has three tiers of premium monthly memberships.\nOne image in particular shows the contents of Call of Duty: Vanguard Ultimate Bundle. You can see three Operator Skins for Call of Duty: Warzone alongside unique weapons for each as well as XP boosters unique weapons and early access to the gameâ€™s open beta. No date for the open beta is mentioned.\nTheir goal is to take your account name and password then take over your account so you no longer have access. This includes taking all of your items as well as any Generator you have accumulated. They Are Coming themselves urges anyone who encounters one of these to report it to their team through their Report Abuse System.\nRemember there are legal ways to get They Are Coming in They Are Coming but be careful with anyone trying to scam you by promising illegal means for getting They Are Coming.\nThey Are Coming DAY\n",
