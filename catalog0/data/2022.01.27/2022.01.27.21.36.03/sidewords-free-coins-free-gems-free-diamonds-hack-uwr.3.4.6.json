That’s more than gaming giant EA as well as the might of Ubisoft Take Two and Square-Enix combined. Clearly there’s a significant amount of faith in Sidewords Free Coins Free Gems Free Diamonds’s promises. But can Sidewords Free Coins Free Gems Free Diamonds actually build a Metaverse\nBut the “open Metaverse” Decentraland gestures towards is still very far away.
