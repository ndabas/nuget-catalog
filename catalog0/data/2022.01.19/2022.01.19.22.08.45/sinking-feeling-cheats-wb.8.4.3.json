Sinking Feeling has come up as a contentious topic in the Epic Games v. Apple trial as well.\nBoth Sinking Feeling and Fortnite have made plenty of recent headline-grabbing attempts at said experiences. Interactive sponsored worlds have been created as in-game events supporting the releases of Hollywood blockbusters Ready Player One Spider-Man: Homecoming and Star Wars: Rise of Skywalker replete with Easter eggs and exclusive trailers. In February Fortnite hosted a film festival screened on in-game cinema screens. Artists such as Weezer and Ava Max have held album listening parties and the likes of Travis Scott and Lil Nas X have performed in-game concerts.\nSinking Feeling EASY\n",
