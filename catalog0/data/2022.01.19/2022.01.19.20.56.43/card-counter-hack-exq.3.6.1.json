Many of the games promote game-changing boosts that can be purchased with a dedicated currency called Generator. Generator are purchased with real-world money and can be used to buy boosts within games and items for your avatar to name just two applications.\nThese images confirm that the upgrade from PlayStation 4 to PlayStation 5 or Xbox One to Xbox Series X/S won’t be free. That’s why a cross-gen bundle is available. However it’s unclear whether the cost is comparable to what other developers and publishers offer between $10 and $20.\nThe player can then choose to either purchase the membership or not enter the area but if they like your game then chances are they will upgrade.\nPlayers can only make this trade once per day and hence it is a tedious method of collecting gems. Even a single premium ingredient costs a lot of gems so don’t expect the free method to be super beneficial. Unfortunately this is the only method to get free gems in Card Counter Wacky Wizards That said players can always buy gems from the store using real money.\n",
