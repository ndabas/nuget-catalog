  "releaseNotes": "Changelog 2.6.0\n\nEnhancements\n\nCore\n\n  - Changed: Refactored method calls resulting in smaller file size.\n\n  - Changed: New wheel format using arrays instead of objects to maintain the order of items. Old wheel format is still supported, but deprecated. See documentation for details.\n\n  - Changed: Cleaned up css.\n\n  - Changed: position method is now public.\n\n  - Changed: Remove setInterval which was running to get update the actual position of a moving wheel. Position is now dynamically calculated only when needed.\n\nCalendar\n\n  - Changed: Performance improved when calendar is updated when moving the wheels on the scroller.\n\n  - Added: Month and year can be changed sepparately in the header.\n\n  - Added: Month and year order in calendar header is now controlled by the 'dateOrder' setting (#122).\n\n  - Added: Tabs for calendar, date, and time controls. Displaying tabs can be automatical (if there is not enough space for all the controls), always on, or always off.\n\n  - Added: Custom color for marked sign and event background.\n\n  - Added: Different styling for marked days (colored bottom line).\n\nLanguages\n\n  - Added: Dutch translation (Thanks to Sven-Depondt - https://github.com/Sven-Depondt).\n\n  - Added: Turkish translation (Thanks to Metin Gökhan Ünal).\n\n  - Added: Japanese translation (Thanks to Johnny Shields - https://github.com/johnnyshields).\n\n\nBugfixes\n\nCore\n\n  - Fixed: Firefox / IE display bug, wheel groups were shown under each other, even if there was enough space (#104).\n\n  - Fixed: Form fields remained disabled in Firefox if page was reloaded before hiding mobiscroll (#126).\n\n  - Fixed: Call stopPropagation on move event to make it work correctly with iScroll (or similar libraries) (#14).\n\n  - Fixed: settings property is now correctly exposed (object reference is kept).\n\nCalendar\n\n  - Fixed: \"dayOfWeek: [0]\" was not working for marked days.\n\n  - Fixed: Date passed to the onDayChange event was not always correct.\n\nSelect\n\n  - Fixed: In multiselect mode old checkmarks were not removed when setValue method was called (#129).\n\nTemperature\n\n  - Fixed: \"°K\" changed to \"K\" on unit wheel (#124).\n\nAnimation\n\n  - Fixed: Added \"-webkit-backface-visibility: hidden;\" to some elements to prevent animation glitches in webkit.\n\njqMobi\n\n  - Fixed: css function returned NaN for margin in outerWidth function.",
