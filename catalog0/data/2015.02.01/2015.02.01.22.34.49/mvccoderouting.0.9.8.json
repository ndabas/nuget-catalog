  "description": "MvcCodeRouting for ASP.NET MVC analyzes your controllers and actions and automatically creates the best possible routes for them.\n         Organize your controllers and views using namespaces (no more areas) that can go as deep as you want.\n         Includes support for hierarchical (a.k.a. RESTful) and also user-defined custom routes (using an attribute).\n         It also supports embedded views (as assembly resources) that can be individually overriden by file views.\n         MvcCodeRouting is a single unified solution that provides namespace-aware automatic route creation, URL generation and views location.",
