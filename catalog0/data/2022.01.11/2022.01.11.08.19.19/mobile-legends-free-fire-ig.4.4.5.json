Pick the Cyclops Eyeball and head over to meet Oz the Wizard. Here you can trade the Cyclops Eyeball with Oz for 20 gems.\nThere are however a few easy things you can do to minimise the risk. First off as mentioned above don’t tell your kid the password to their mobile legends free fire account. The reason behind this is the ‘mobile legends free fire’ scams that proliferate the internet. These sites get your details by disguising themselves as sites that look like an official mobile legends free fire page and encourage people to log into their mobile legends free fire account via their page to claim ‘mobile legends free fire’. If you do this you have just given the scammers all of the information they need to take over the account and clear it out. No matter how tempting these sites are you need to know that there is NO SUCH THING AS mobile legends free fire. Only purchase Generator using the methods mentioned before.\nThe Portal-meets-Halo arena shooter Splitgate is perhaps the biggest gaming industry success story of 2021. After languishing for two years Splitgate found major success recently. The free-to-play game has been downloaded more than two million times so far and has received almost universal acclaim. Now there is more good news for Splitgate fans on console as the studio has announced the game will have its own upgraded version for current-gen consoles.\nThis is done by going to Game Settings selecting the Monetization tab toggling the Private Servers and then you are able to set a price that you want players to pay.\nThere are also 12 vehicles with padlocks on them and these are locked behind the much more expensive Vehicle Pack Pass. That will cost 799 Generator although it must be said the vehicles in this pass are definitely the nicest in the game. As you can see there are vehicles for all levels of players in Brookhaven from those who wish to play for free or save their Generator and those who don’t mind spend some money to get what they want.\n Jamie Moorcroft-Sharp  August 12 2021 CALL OF DUTY: VANGUARDNEWS\n",
