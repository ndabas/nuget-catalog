  "releaseNotes": "The v6.0.0 release has done a major overhaul in the naming of monitors to make it simpler for new users of the API.\nBREAKING CHANGES**\n`Timer.Register(long)` has been removed. Replace use with `Timer.Register(StopWatch)` or `Timer.Register(TimeSpan)`\n`OkanshiMonitor.HealthCheck()` has been removed. Replace use with a `Gauge`\n`LongTaskTimer` has been removed\n`BasicCounter` has been renamed to `CumulativeCounter` to better explain what it does\n`PeakRateCounter` has been renamed to `Counter`, as it was hard to figure out what PeakRateCounter meant\n`BasicTimer` has been renamed to `Timer`, as it was hard to figure out what BasicTimer meant\n`BasicGauge` has been renamed to `Gauge`, as it was hard to figure out what BasicGauge meant\n`DataPoint` has been deleted as it was no longer used internally\n`DataSourceType` has been removed, instead descriptive names should be used\nThe tag statistic has been removed from the Timer, this has been replaced by value names\n`OkanshiMonitor.DefaultTags` has been change to an `ISet&lt;Tag&gt;` to make it clear how duplicates are handled\n`InfluxDB.WriteOnly` dependency has been updated to version 3.1.0",
