If you make a particularly popular design the Generator will start to flow in before you know it.\nWhat is a Generator Generator Beats me because they don't exist. Or rather they do but they're a complete scam.\nTypically promo codes for the game change and are released every month. Therefore you have to make sure you find the promo codes for the correct month and use them before the next one arrives.\nFree Basketball Club Story Generator - Basketball Club Story Generator\nGenerally speaking Basketball Club Story is a safe environment for your kids to spend time in but be warned there are people out there who try to take advantage of the fact that most people playing Basketball Club Story are kids. To ensure that your kids canâ€™t get scammed I recommend keeping their Basketball Club Story password a secret from them so that they can never accidentally give it away.\nAfter this head to the \"Create\" tab at the top of the Basketball Club Story site and select Shirts or Pants. From here click the gear icon to the left of the clothing click Configure and then Sales. This brings up a screen that prompts the player to put in a Generator price for their item.\n",
