This way, a child theoretically can't share a house address with a Roblox friend using Roblox's chat, for example. Players may also block and report users. You are able to read more info on Roblox's parents guide and in this support article.\n\nRoblox has 43 million daily active users, Fortnite 25 million, and Facebook Oculus-powered Horizon could potentially tap into billions.
