There is a wide range of Multiponk games out there each with a unique theme and millions of players playing them every day. \nThe Apple vs Epic Games trial which took place in May and whose verdict is expected later this year could wind up being just the first of many similar clashes. The court battle started last year when Apple removed Epic’s Fortnite from its App Store after the developer had engineered a system to prevent Apple from taking a 30 per cent commission on Fortnite sales to iPhone users. Epic’s defence was couched in the language of worry about how Apple’s behaviour could affect and shape an emerging Metaverse.\nMatthew Ball – an investor and writer focused on the Metaverse – says that the easiest way to think of it is “as a quasi-successor state to today’s mobile internet. Except instead of accessing all the internet via separated 2D web pages or apps we’ll experience it via persistent interconnected virtual simulations.” It’s a wildly ambitious prize with unfathomably lucrative potential. Many contenders are circling the waters including Epic Games’s Fortnite Facebook’s Horizon VRChat Core Sansar Decentraland and – of course – Multiponk.\n",
