  "releaseNotes": "History\n      6/11/2021 Version 2.3.7832\n      1. Update to BLE Advertising support for Heartbeatz.\n      \n      1/28/2021 Version 2.2.7698\n      1. Support for the Activio step counter.\n      2. Programming progress indicator update.\n      3. Bug fix for null reference when updating WASP Configuration.\n      4. Bug fix for Fitness Equipment Resistance Level.\n      5. Add .NET Core 2.1 build to NuGet.\n      6. BLE Advertising support for Heartbeatz.\n\n      12/5/2019 Version 2.1.7278\n      1. BREAKING CHANGE: Upgraded target framework to .NET 4.5.2. Users of the class library may need to retarget their applications.\n      2. The property CollectionVerbosity has been deprecated as of 6/1/2019 and may be removed in a future release. Please use the static property Logger.LogLevel for future development.\n      3. Log files are now written to the directory WaspLogs. Rolling log files are generated with a rolling interval of daily. The trace listener can be removed from the config file.\n      4. ActivityMonitor.ActivityDistanceKm now reports the correct distance in kilometers.\n      5. Removed dependency on Ionic NuGet package.\n      6. Improved heart rate monitor handling.\n      7. WaspCollection now has a property to IgnoreBleMessages.\n      8. Added support for the Concept 2 Rower in the FitnessEquipmentControls namespace.\n      9. Writes to a WASP over a TCP control connection are now done asynchronously.\n      10. The timeout for a write over a TCP control connection can be set when invoking RequestConnection. The default is infinite.\n      11. Added support for Polar Ignite BLE Heart Rate Monitor.\n      12. Updated BikeSpeed/BikeCadence sensor to v2.1 of the ANT+ profile.\n      13. Some WASP-PoE return incorrect frequency info in the extended query response and will be ignored. The AntFrequency array will default to all 0xFF (invalid). Does not affect WASP-N.\n      14. The AntFrequency array will be set to the correct values when a connection (call RequestConnection) is made to WASP-PoE. Does not affect WASP-N.\n      15. Added the Nordic Skier to the fitness equipment class.\n      16. Added Manufacturer Specific Data Pages Event to AntDevice base class.\n\n      5/13/2019 Version 1.53\n      1. Added MessageQueueCount property to AntDevice to provide visibility into the number of messages in the AntDevice queue.\n      2. Additional information in log file to show progress as messages are sent to ANT devices. Set Wasp.CollectionVerbosity to Wasp.WaspLogLevel.Moderate or higher to view data.\n      3. Changed default ANT sensor message Stale timeout to 10 seconds.\n      4. Improved performance of sending commands to ANT+ sensors to avoid multiple simultaneous messages to the same sensor.\n      5. GetStrongestWasp() is now automatically called before sending commands to ANT devices. We recommend that client applications no longer\n      call GetStrongestWasp() as this is now handled internally. Calling this method again may incur a small performance penalty.\n      6. Improved time to identify sensors with the AWE interface.\n      7. Exposed the AntDevice MessageQueueFull and MessageQueueCount properties to client programs to track number of messages waiting to be sent to devices.\n      8. Added ability to empty the AntDevice message queue.\n      9. Only allow valid Fitness Equipment device state transitions.\n      10. Corrected potential offset error when clearing accumulated Fitness Equipment device data.\n      11. Added Water Rower decode to provide rapid response from the rower broadcasting page.\n      12. Added override parameter to SetGymMode to allow setting Heart Rate Monitors to Gym Mode without having to request capabilities first.\n      13. Geocache::Program now returns false if Hint is not set before programming.\n      14. First Generation WASP-PoE radios are now correctly identified.\n      15. Added CommandTimedout flag to indicate that the last command to an ANT sensor timed out before it could be transmitted.\n      16. Added GEM Maintenance data decode.\n      17. Added AweBleAcknowledgeEvent to signal that the Apple Watch has processed a command sent from the PC.\n      18. Added automatic retry to AWE commands if Apple Watch did not acknowledge command.",
