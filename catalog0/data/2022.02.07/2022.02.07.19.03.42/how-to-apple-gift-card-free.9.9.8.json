Dispose of it when it's used up After purchasing an iTunes card, I think it will be charged to your Apple account.\n\nReference: How to charge your iTunes card\n\nAfter that, don't you wonder what to do with the iTunes card you used?\n\nOn this page, I will explain how to handle used iTunes cards. Of course, a used iTunes card can no longer be used.\n\nTherefore, unless you keep it for your collection, you can throw it away.\n\nYou may not feel like you're using it much because you just read the code, but it doesn't make any sense to have a used iTunes card.\n\nPersonally, I think it's okay to dispose of it in the sense that it cleans the room.

If you see, you know that this iTunes card has been used.\n\nTherefore, it is okay to dispose of this iTunes card. If you just bought an iTunes card and haven't registered for an account yet, but you get a used message, you may be worried.\n\nIn that case, try the following measures. If you buy it at an intermediary site, you may have trouble, so try to buy an iTunes card sold at convenience stores and home electronics retail stores as much as possible.\n\nFinally, the iTunes card",
