  "description": "This is a general purpose commons library that I've built mostly for my own use within applications that I build (but obviously you are welcome to use it should you choose). The goal is to have an easy-to-use and uniform yet modular and pluggable facility to handle common cross-cutting concerns in my applications, thereby freeing me up to focus on the actual application concerns and hopefully making it easier and faster to build them.\n      In general, the library consists of interfaces or SPIs along with ways to access them (using MEF). One can then build implementations for these interfaces (i.e. providers) and hook them up to an application through configuration. What this does for me is provide a uniform way to access these services in all my applications while allowing me to switch or extend providers as I see fit.\n      For more detailed information and documentation, please visit the GitHub page for this repository at http://aashishkoirala.github.io/commons. You can find more of my stuff by visiting my page at http://aashishkoirala.github.io.\n      The package is free to download and use. The source code is open and provided under the GPL license.",

  "releaseNotes": "Added new Aspects namespace that includes components to support aspect-oriented programming.\n      Breaking changes to the DataAccess namespace: a unit of work now spawns typed, scoped repositories that expose actual data access methods. This aligns more closely with my understanding of the unit-of-work/repository patterns.\n      Added new DomainDriven namespace that includes components to support domain-driven design (DDD).\n      Security components related to certificates and WIF.\n      Bunch of service-related components having to do with WCF as well as an OperationResult group of classes that represent values and status of results of service operations.\n      Added new Threading namespace for concurrency components- presently LockedObject and LockedValue classes that encapsulate reader/writer locking.\n      Added various constructs such as an EnumDescription attribute for enum mebmers, a Perhaps class to represent things that may not be there, an IProviderSource interface to standardize named provider interfaces, along with new Uri handling methods.\n      Breaking changes- removed Web components because: 1) all web-based components will be included in a new Commons Web Library, 2) I am deprecating bundling and OAuth-type security constructs that were originally defined in the Web namespace.",
