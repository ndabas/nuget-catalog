  "releaseNotes": "Notice:\n    This package is in a public preview release.\n    This package is intended to work with .net full framework 4.6.2, 4.7.2 and 4.8, .net core 3.1, 5.0 and 6.0\n    General Documentation is the same as CrmServiceClient and can be found here:\n        https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.xrm.tooling.connector.crmserviceclient?view=dynamics-xrmtooling-ce-9\n    Connection String Docs can be found here:\n        https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/developer/common-data-service/xrm-tooling/use-connection-strings-xrm-tooling-connect\n    Note: that only AD on FullFramework, OAuth, Certificate, ClientSecret Authentication types are supported at this time.\n\n0.6.5:\nAccepted fixes requested by Git user 0xced\nFixed Null ref bug for missing redirect URI (if it gets that far) https://github.com/microsoft/PowerPlatform-DataverseServiceClient/pull/246\nFixed Missing ConfigureAwait's on some Async methods in auth chain. https://github.com/microsoft/PowerPlatform-DataverseServiceClient/pull/247\nAdded Discovery Filter support for Korea and Norway GEO's\n\n0.6.1:\nMinor Bump to 0.6.x - *Should* be last bump prior to 1.0. \n\nAdded initial support for AD auth for OnPremise.  This will work for full framework only. \nAdded new constructor that will accept a ConnectionOptions class and a ConfigurationOptions Options Object.  This constructor is currently not fully implemented. \n    This is prep work for a builder process and intended to unify the connection flow to a single constructor at some point in the future. \n    The goal of this work will be to resolve the issues caused by lazy loading hosts. \nFixed a bug in Logger when working with Connection Strings where log events would not be correctly generated. \nSpeculative fix for GIT issue #219 and #220\nFixed a bug where LastError was not properly reset, fixed Git #229\nFixed Error message issue between onPrem and onLine , Fixed Git #232\nAdded configuration support to allow for better memory management of very large return sets,  Git #207 \n    New AppSetting is called \"MaxBufferPoolSizeOveride\" - there is currently not a way to set this via code at runtime. \n    Support for configuration of this will be added as part of the new Constructor for .net core, .net framework can use it by setting the appsetting value now.\nFixed exceptions not being thrown from several paths during login flows. \n\n-- WARNING -- \n.net 3.0 Target Removed from Nuget packages. \nREFACTORED helpers and utilities for the DataverseServiceClient into the Microsoft.PowerPlatform.Dataverse.Client.Extensions Namespace of the DataverseClient.\nDependency changes:\n    Removed Microsoft.Dynamics.Messages.Sdk.nuspec for Dynamics messages at this time.  This will return in the future in some form. \n    Removed Microsoft.Cds.Sdk.Proxy.dll from Package and replaced with Microsoft.Crm.Sdk.Proxy.dll in package. \n    System.Text.Json moved to 6.0.2 min dependency.\n        -- Note: As of this writing, when using Azure functions you cannot use Microsoft.Net.Sdk.Functions.3.0.12 or .3.0.13 due to blocks on System.Text.Json dependencies.  You need to either use .3.0.11 or move up to 4.x \n    System.ServiceModel.Http moved to 4.9.0 due to internal dependencies on Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk\n\n\n0.5.17:\n Accepted fix requested here: https://github.com/microsoft/PowerPlatform-DataverseServiceClient/issues/205\n  fixing delete by alternate key request in client. \n Fixed dependency issue for System.Security.Premisions  (git #203)  \n Refactored AuthorityResolver to discover AAD authentication authorities to allow for direct access by other clients. \n\n\n0.5.10:\nAdded new property \"RecommendedDegreesOfParallelism\". \n    This property will report the recommended number of threads for communicating with Dataverse.\n\n0.5.8:\nChanged internal dependencies to better align with Dataverse Server.\nFixed an issue with updating ManyToOneRelationship based attributes.\nFixed an issue with activity parties relationships.\n\n0.5.7:\nRemoved Sealed attribute from the Service Client Class. \nFixed an issue with null values being sent to the API causing a null exception to be raised. \nFixed missing nuget dependency for Microsoft.Identity.Client.Extensions.Msal, Nuget now properly includes that package. \n\n0.5.5: \nFixed a nuget dependency issue for Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.Memory\n    Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.Memory, min version 3.1.8\n\n0.5.4:\nFixed and issue with the client being non-castable to IOrganizationServiceAsync, Client will now cast again. (Internal Report)\n    Special note: \n        IOrganizationServiceAsync has async methods without cancellation support. this is required for service mapping as the dataverse server does not natively support this feature. \n        IOrganizationServiceAsync2 has async methods WITH cancellation support.  \n        This surfaces in the client as 2 forms of each async method and is currently necessary to support internal auto generation of contracts for service communication. We will work to improve this in the future.\n        Cancellation events will currently raise an OperationCancelled Exception, this can either be the topmost exception, or embedded in a DataverseException.\n        Cancellation methods are 'preferred' if you need to support cancellation in your application.\nFixed an issue with External authentication type not being properly passed though to cloned clients.  (git #162)\n\n0.5.2:\n***** Breaking Changes *****\nRemoved the constructor:\n    public ServiceClient(OrganizationWebProxyClient externalOrgWebProxyClient, ILogger logger = null)\n        Removed as we are refactoring how we will accept an external created client for internal use cases.\nContract change:\n    Added Support to set token file storage location back to connection string and constructors supporting User Authentication.\n    Modified DiscoverOrganizationsAsync to return a new return object called DiscoverOrganizationsResult\n    Modified Exception type thrown when external authentication fail to return DataverseOperationExecption vs general exception.\n\nUpdates:\nAccepted suggestion to Updated logic to detect SDK runtime version for client.  Thanks to GitHub user 0xced\nUpdated behavior of Token refresh to reduce cache hits, Optimized token lookup for cache hits over network calls.\nAdded Handlers to support timeouts from AAD Token service. (GIT #148)\nAdded InMemory Token Cache system for S2S flows. (GIT #144)\n    This pulls a new dependency on Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.Memory, min version 5.0.0\nAdded FileToken Storage Provider back into Client - works for User Access flows only... Does not work for S2S accounts.\nAdded configuration override support for setting MSAL Token Acquire Timeout, Retry Count, and MSALPIILogger\n    MSAL Token Timeout control : appsetting = MSALRequestTimeoutOverride,  default is 30 seconds.\n    MSAL Token Acquire retry count: appsetting = MSALRequestRetryCountOverride, default is 3.\n    MSAL Allow PII in Log data: appsetting = MSALLogPII, default is false\nUpdated Async Implementation older SDK flow ( non-OData ) which should improve thread support. (Git #146)\nUpdated Internal interaction behaviors for communication to Dataverse Server\n    Added temp properties to allow for field control of this if the behavior does not work as intended. \nFixed an issue where an Guid.Empty Session ID was set the server.\nFixed an issue where Create and Update Operations would not properly respect API allowed fields for create or update. (Git #163)\nFixed an issue where logical name was being used instead of Schema name for Activity parties (Git #166)\n\n0.4.20:\nFixed Connection Creation \"Hang\" behavior that could occur when trying to create a Dataverse Service Client inside a thread.\nFixed an issue with ILogger not propagating correctly when used with connection string flows.\nFixed an issue when attempting to Null a lookup that would cause a Microsoft.OData.ODataException: Does not support untyped value in non-open type error\nChanged the behavior of Update message to be consistent with Organization Service Update behavior instead of an Upsert behavior.\nAdded compensating code to deal with a null ref issue when logging which could cause a client crash.\nAdded optional WebAPI support during login and solution import & export operations\nRefactored ServiceClient and ConnectionService\n\n0.4.19:\nUpdated behavior of ImportSolutionAsync to leverage updated Dataverse behavior post 9.2 release.\nUpdated Display name for Northamerica 2 Region to reflect that it is more commonly know as GCC.\nUpdated Newtonsoft.Json to v11.0.2 to match server.\nFixed an issue with ActivityParty when using an Entity Array vs an EntityCollection for ActivityParties\n\n0.4.12:\nFixed an issue raised when updating some entities\\attributes values to null.\nFixed and issue with DataTime formatting for Timezone independent, Timezone specific, and 'normal' DateTime types.\nUpdate for Current Dataverse System Messages.\n\n0.4.11:\nUpdate for Current Dataverse System Messages.\nFixed an issue where authentication could fail during throttling due to token not being refreshed on retry.\nAdding Exception behaviors for all Metadata Operations.\nAdding EnableAffinityCookie to allow for override of Affinity behavior when interacting with Dataverse.\n    In general, users should not manipulate this property. more details can be found here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/developer/data-platform/api-limits#remove-the-affinity-cookie\nAdding support for enhanced features for solution import.\n\n0.4.6:\nExposing ILogger support on all constructors and Static API commands.\n\n0.4.4:\nAdded support for related entity create as part of general \"create\" operation.\nUpdated Async Operations to return task's for async methods that were returning void's\nUpdated DataverseOperationException to include HttpOperationResponse, where it exists.\nFixed issue with Cloned Connections not refreshing their tokens on token expiration\nUpdated Logger to remove string builder property\nAdded Initial code for ILogger implementation.
