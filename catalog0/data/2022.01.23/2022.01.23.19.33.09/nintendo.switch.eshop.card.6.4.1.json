  "description": "Nintendo Switch eShop Sees Big Server Issues Christmas Morning (Update: It's Fine Now)\n\nVISIT HERE üëâüëâüëâüëâ https://gamesapp.pro/nintendo\n\nVISIT HERE üëâüëâüëâüëâ https://gamesapp.pro/nintendo\n\n\nAcross the country, folks everywhere are unwrapping their new Nintendo portable hardware, booting up their accounts, and trying to buy new digital games. But over the last few hours, per social media, the Nintendo Switch storefront known as the eShop has been in and out of commission. Sometimes it loads, albeit slowly. Other times, you can‚Äôt access the strangely laggy orange menus to rebuy Mario Kart 8 for the third time, alas.\n\nour own tests, the eShop is back up and running after experiencing some issues on Christmas.\n\nOriginal story continues below\n\nUnder error code 2811-7429, the message that stares back at you after some loading struggle simply says that the console is unable to connect to server and says that you should try again later. Kotaku has reached out to Nintendo for more information on when users can expect the service to come back. The official online server website says, ‚ÄúWe are currently experiencing difficulties with our network services.‚Äù\n\n\nOcarina Of Time Gets Surprise Emulation Fix On Switch\nThe 14 Best Games For The PlayStation 5\nA Look Inside Nintendo‚Äôs Old Kyoto Headquarters\nFor the most part, this shouldn‚Äôt be too disruptive when it comes to enjoying the console. You can still boot up whatever games you already own, you just can‚Äôt buy new stuff or download DLC and the like. Granted, you also can‚Äôt redeem gift cards, which is likely a bummer for anyone who received them as presents this morning. That‚Äôs likely a ton of people, huh? A lot of people who are surely loading and re-loading hoping that something has changed this time...oh, this will probably be a while.\n\nOriginal Final Fantasy VII Looks Gorgeous At 60FPS\nTwitch Star Ninja Threatens Pokimane With Legal Action For Alleged 'Harassment'\nNetflix's Cuphead Trailer Is Slightly E",
