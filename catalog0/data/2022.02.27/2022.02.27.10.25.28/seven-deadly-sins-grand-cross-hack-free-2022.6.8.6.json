The seven deadly sins, as identified by Pope Gregory 1 in the late sixth century, are considered categories of sin:\n\nPride, Envy, Wrath, Gluttony, Lust, Sloth, and Greed. Many think the deadly seven are recorded in the Bible. Surprisingly, even though each of the seven is a sin, this list is not contained in Scripture. The history of this sin categorization began in the year 400.\n\nEvagrius Ponticus a fourth-century monk, described eight evils to resist. Two centuries later Pope Gregory 1, refined the inventory to seven. Almost every sin can be placed in one of these seven categories. Isaiah 14:13-14 tells us pride and selfishness are related to each of the seven and are viewed as the root causes of all sin.\n\nThe Seven Deadly Sins in the Bible Throughout the sweep of the Scripture, these seven specific sins are addressed",
