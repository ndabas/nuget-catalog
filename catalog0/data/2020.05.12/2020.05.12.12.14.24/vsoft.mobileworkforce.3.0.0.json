  "releaseNotes": "New major API version was introduced. All changes listed below apply to new endpoints only. Backward compatibility for all existing methods is preserved and no immediate client side code changes are required after the software.\n\n    Added v3 endpoint addressing for all API methods. All v3 endpoints use REST resource based endpoint naming scheme and HTTP status codes for failure communication (400 for validation errors, 404 for not existing objects).\n    Added parameter expand in the GetMobileUserGroups method that allows to include additional data. It supports comma-separated strings of fields to include. Currently supported values: expand-users.\n    Added data querying methods for mobile users (GetMobileUsers) and tasks (GetTasks). These methods support generic data filtering and ordering. You can read more on the Data queries page.\n\nSome API fields were removed:\n\n    Task data no longer contains TaskAddress, Coordinates and PhoneNumber fields. Addresses and phone numbers should be specified only in TaskData.MetaData.Addresses and TaskData.MetaData.PhoneNumbers fields respectively.\n    Optional user provided task geolocation data can now be specified for each individual task address using TaskData.MetaData.Addresses.Coordinates field.\n    TaskData.Id field was removed form data used by the AddTask and UpdateTask methods. New endpoint url is now used to pass the id instead.\n\nSome API fields were renamed:\n\n    TaskData.MetaData.History was renamed to TaskData.MetaData.CaseHistory.\n    TaskData.MetaData.CaseDetails.IsInCase was renamed to TaskData.MetaData.CaseDetails.InCase.\n    TaskData.MetaData.Payments.No was renamed to TaskData.MetaData.Payments.Number.\n    ReportData.Phones was renamed to ReportData.PhoneNumbers.\n\nSome API fields were added:\n\n    Result.Code: contains error class code in case of an error result.\n    TaskData.DryRun: allows executing only a validation phase of AddTask and UpdateTask methods.\n\nSome API methods were deprecated:\n\n    GetBankingTaskOrNull: use GetTaskOrNull method instead.\n    GetBankingReportOrNull: use GetReportOrNull method instead.\n    AddBankingTask: user AddTask method instead.\n    UpdateBankingTask: use UpdateTask method instead.\n    GetObjectNames: use GetPredefinedCategories method instead.\n    GetUsers: use GetMobileUsers method method instead.\n    ValidateTask: use DryRun param of AddTask method instead.\n    ValidateUpdateTask: use DryRun param of UpdateTask method instead.\n\nBehavior changes introduced in v3 methods (pre v3 endpoints are not affected):\n\n    Methods that return Result data type will now additionally use HTTP 400 code for data communicating validation errors and HTTP 404 code when related data object is not found.\n    GetTaskPayments, GetTaskActions, GetUserSchedule, GetJobStatus will now use HTTP 404 code when object related to the query does not exist.\n    GetMobileUserSchedule now returns tasks from all systems.\n\nDownloading task data created in previous system versions:\n\n    Main task address previously specified in the TaskData will now be automatically included in the TaskData.MetaData.Address collection. Such an address will have its id set to the constant value of 'main-d23ce527f309'. The address will be included only if Addresses collection does not contain any address with same data as main address.\n    Main task phone number previously specified in the TaskData will now be automatically included in the TaskData.MetaData.PhoneNumbers collection. Such a number will have its id set to the constant value of 'main-d23ce527f309'. The number will be included only if PhoneNumbers collection does not already contain specified number.\n    These changes affect only the data returned by the GetTaskOrNull method.\n    Address and phone number with special id 'main-d23ce527f309' will not be sent to the mobile clients as a part of the meta data.",
