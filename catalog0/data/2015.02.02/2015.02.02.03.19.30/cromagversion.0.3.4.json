  "description": "An MSBuild project integration that makes it easy to keep version numbers synced across all projects in a solution based on a simple date scheme and user provided major / minor version numbers.  Provides a single source of truth for versioning, and modifies it at build time as necessary to keep assembly metadata fresh.",

  "releaseNotes": "* File generation is now provided through a T4 template instead of via\n        an imported MSBuild target.  This was necessary to better support\n        package restore, and should be a transparent under-the-hood change.\n        * Includes MonoDevelops TextTransform.exe to codegen instead of relying\n        on anything that ships with Visual Studio\n        * Adds a new CROMAG variable that must be defined to generate versioning\n        code - by default this is enabled for any non-DEBUG builds\n        * Removed the dependency on an msbuild mercurial task\n        * Breaking change - no longer emits MSBuild variables $(VersionNumber)\n        $(Changeset) $(BuildVersion) or $(RevisionVersion)\n        * Minor bugfixes to handle project paths with spaces, and non-standard\n        Git and Mercurial locations on disk.\n        * Initial DEBUG builds would fail until a RELEASE build generated info",
