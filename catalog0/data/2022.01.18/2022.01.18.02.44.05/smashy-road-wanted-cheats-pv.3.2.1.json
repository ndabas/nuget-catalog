Tix didn’t cost money and players could earn by it logging in daily visiting their Place and a number of other ways. Tix could also be converted into Generator which is something players used to do a lot. Considering that it was just a free way to earn Generator people started creating alternate accounts to get more Generator and it almost entirely killed the point of Generator.\nIt's a good way to spark creativity and make a little bit of spending currency on the side too. If you make a particularly popular design the Generator will start to flow in before you know it.\nGems are a completely new currency added to Wacky Wizards in Smashy Road Wanted. While players can pay for these by spending their Generator from the store it’s also possible to get your hands on them for free. In this guide we’ll explain how to get Gems in Wacky Wizards so you can get spending to your heart’s content.\nDatamined Call of Duty: Vanguard artwork and editions confirm WW2 setting open beta and more\nThere are also 12 vehicles with padlocks on them and these are locked behind the much more expensive Vehicle Pack Pass. That will cost 799 Generator although it must be said the vehicles in this pass are definitely the nicest in the game. As you can see there are vehicles for all levels of players in Brookhaven from those who wish to play for free or save their Generator and those who don’t mind spend some money to get what they want.\nFREE Smashy Road Wanted - Smashy Road Wanted GENERATOR\n",
