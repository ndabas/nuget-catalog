  "description": "[Alpha Release] - Light object model shim that abstracts Selenium WebDriver operations and simplifies running test automation with multiple browsers. SeleniumShim uses implicit wait on timeout which solves race conditions when calling FindElement while the browser de-serialization process is still running and race conditions with the Java Script engine when the WebElement is present but the Java Script is not ready to execute.",

  "releaseNotes": "Retry delay is now adjustable. Default is 1000ms. Lower delay for faster UI action. Raise delay when using MVVM, MVC tools like Angular.js to give script logic time to process between user actions (like email and password strength verification for example). Added implicit retry on timeout for both calls to FindElement(...) and user actions on IWebElement objects (e.g. Click()). These additional implicit retry on timeout loops solve race conditions where WebElement is rendered by the browser but the Java Script engine is not ready to execute. Tested on a web site designed with Angular.js where this issue was reproducable.",
