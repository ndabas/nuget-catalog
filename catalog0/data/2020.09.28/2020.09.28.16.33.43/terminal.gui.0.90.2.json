  "releaseNotes": "This (0.90) is the \"Feature Complete\" pre-release of Terminal.Gui (aka gui.cs) 1.0. This release is a signficant upgrade from the previous published release (0.81). Most of the major changes and bug fixes are listed below. NOTE: This release includes breaking changes to the API; we will strive to avoid any more breaking changes before 1.0.\n\n      What's new:\n      * New sample/demo app - UI Catalog - Replaces demo.cs with an easy to use and extend set of demo scenarios. (Thanks @tig!)\n      * The API documentation is completely revamped and updated. Readme upated. Contributors guide added (Thanks @tig!)\n      * MenuBar can now have MenuItems directly (enables top-level menu items with no submenu). (Thanks @tig!)\n      * API semantics are much more consistent across classes. For example, all events are now defined in terms of event Action instead of EventHanlder. BREAKING CHANGE. (Thanks @bdisp, @worldbeater, and @tig!)\n      * The project has been refactored an reorganized to reduce risk of bugs and make it easier to contribute.\n      * Symbols are now included with the nuget package.\n\n      Fixes/Improvements (partial list; see Github issues for complete list):\n      * Fixes #396 - Text alignnment issues.

(Thanks @tig!)\n      * Fixes #432 - MessageBox does not deal with long text; width/height params are goofy. (Thanks @tig!)\n      * Fixes #35 - Dialog should have 1 char padding. (Thanks @tig!)\n      * `MessageBox.Query` called with `width` and `height` == 0 get auto-size behavior. A new constructor is added making this easy to use. (Thanks @tig!)\n      * Multi-line `MessageBox`es are now supported. Just use `\\n` to add lines. The height of the MessageBox will adjust automatically. (Thanks @tig!)\n      * The `MessageBoxes` Scenario in UI Catalog provides a full demo/test-case. (Thanks @tig!)\n      * `Dialog` called with `width` and `height` == 0 are sized to 85% container. A new constructor is added making this easy to use. (Thanks @tig!)\n      * Dialog (and MessageBox `Buttons` are now dynamically laid out using Computed layout. (Thanks @tig!)\n      * A `Dialogs` Scenario has been added to UI Catalog making it easy to test the API.

(Thanks @tig!)\n      * All UI Catalog scenarios that use `Dialog` or `MessageBox` now use the simplified API. (Thanks @tig!)\n      * `Terminal.Gui.dll` now has version metadata and UI Catalog's about box displays it as a test case. (Thanks @tig!)\n      * Button, Dialog, and MessageBox API documentation has been updated/revised.

I need @BDisp's help on this.\n      *   Supports \"infinite scrolling\" via the new OnDrawContent/DrawContent event on the View class.\n      *   The Scrolling Scenario was enhanced to demo dynamically adding/removing horizontal/vertical scrollbars (and to prove it was working right).\n      * The Checkbox.Toggled event is now an EventHandler event and passes previous state.
