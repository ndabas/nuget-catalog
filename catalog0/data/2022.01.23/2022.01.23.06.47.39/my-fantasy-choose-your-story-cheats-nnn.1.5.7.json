That’s a tremendous number! But since My Fantasy Choose Your Story put that stat in the documents it had to file before going public it seems like a safe bet. If My Fantasy Choose Your Story lied to shareholders there’d probably be hell to pay.\nMy Fantasy Choose Your Story - My Fantasy Choose Your Story GENERATOR\nMy Fantasy Choose Your Story - My Fantasy Choose Your Story GENERATOR\nApparently these Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5 version upgrades had been in the works for a while and the game’s recent surge in popularity had actually delayed them as the influx of new players and increased server load took priority. Talk about suffering from success.\nThe Generator stipend is only mentioned because technically you're still receiving My Fantasy Choose Your Story. However you have to pay a monthly membership for it. My Fantasy Choose Your Story has three tiers of premium monthly memberships.\nIf you sign up for a premium membership then you are automatically given a stipend of so many Generator each month. If you pay $4.99 per month then you will receive 450 Generator while those paying $9.99 a month will be given 1000 Generator per month.\n",
