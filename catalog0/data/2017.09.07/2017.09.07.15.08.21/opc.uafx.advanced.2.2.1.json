  "releaseNotes": "= 06.09.2017 - V2.2.1.0 =\n* New       Added support for incomplete certificate chains. In cases there the opponent provides a\n            certificate which is signed by an unknown issuer. This is for example the case when\n            trying to connect to a Siemens SIMOTION.\n* New       Enhanced support for failed certificate validations using the\n            CertificateValidationFailed events in the OpcClient and OpcServer class.\n\n= 01.09.2017 - V2.2.0.0 =\n* New       Added GetReferenceType to resolve the according OpcReferenceType for a given OpcNodeId\n            of the type of reference.\n* Changed   Removed special handling of attribute DataType in OpcNodeInfo.Attribute(). This means\n            that there is no longer a OpcDataType value provided. Instead the data type dependent\n            OpcNodeId is provided.\n* New       Implemented basic support for Object nodes and extended support for Variable nodes,\n            also implemented generic support for Type nodes (including ObjectTypes, VariableTypes\n            and DataTypes) while browsing nodes.\n* New       Using the OpcVariableNodeInfo, OpcObjectNodeInfo and OpcTypeNodeInfo it is now possible\n            to browse the address space using additional information about the nodes provided. This\n            also includes e.g. the type information of a variable node including all its type\n            specific metadata including super und sub types.\n* New       Prepared framework for use under .NET Standard and .NET Core 2.0.\n* New       Introduced LicenseInfo property on all Licenser classes to provide some information\n            about the license conditions used.\n\n= 01.08.2017 - V2.1.0.0 =\n* New       Updated to OPC UA Foundation stack V1.3.342.0.\n\n= 05.06.2017 - V2.0.1.1 =\n* New       Register/Unregister-Address methods and new Addresses method to maintain the different\n            base addresses of an OpcServerBase instance.\n* Fixed     Wrong naming of IsNodeAccessable in OpcNodeManager to IsNodeAccessible.\n* Fixed     Issue with malformed node namespaces using a namespace URI just build from a scheme in\n            case of OpcNamespace.ToString() is called (= FormatException).\n* Fixed     Issue with wrong implicit interpretation of status codes to result information.\n\n= 24.05.2017 - V2.0.1.0 =\n* New       Added much more details to the message of an OpcException and to the description of\n            an OpcStatus/OpcResult instance to better indicate the source/reason/outcome of an\n            operation.\n\n= 21.05.2017 - V2.0.0.0 =\n* New       Changed Assembly Version to 2.0.0.0.\n* New       Implemented OpcCertificateSettings to configure an application instance certificate\n            which can be created through the OpcCertificateManager.\n* Fixed     Issue with wrong configured application certificates using a store path in cases there\n            the certificate can not located under such a path.\n* Fixed     Issue with wrong stored username+password pair in UserName ACL that led to unsuccessful\n            user authentication.\n* Fixed     Issue when creating an OpcNodeId using string+int32 pair, there the int32 was not used\n            for the namespace index of the new node identifier.\n* Fixed     Issue with OpcServerBase.Certificate and OpcClient.Certificate in case there the\n            certificate is not stored in the ApplicationStore of the certificate stores.\n* New       Introduced OpcClientCertificateStores (available through OpcClient.CertificateStores)\n            and OpcServerCertitificateStores (available through OpcServerBase.CertificateStores)\n            to provide a fluent API for client and server to manage and maintain their certificate\n            stores.\n* New       Introduced OpcClientServices (available through OpcClient.Services) to provide a\n            service based API to setup the different services used the client.\n* Removed   \"OpcValue.SourceLabel\" and \"OpcValue.ServerLabel\" this also includes that the\n            \"OpcValueLabel\" class does not longer exists. The provided properties are now provided\n            directly the \"OpcValue\" class. Just take use of the \"OpcValue.ServerXy\" and\n            \"OpcValue.SourceXy\" properties.\n* New       IOpcWriteNodesService does now support an automatic discovery how the server does\n            expect the value of the SourceTimestamp of an OpcValue to write. The automatic\n            determination can be disabled by setting an explicit OpcTimestampSource using the\n            IOpcWriteNdoesService.TimestampSource property. Note: The IOpcWriteNodesService\n            instance can be accessed using the OpcClient.Services.WriteNodes property.\n* New       Removed usage of the obsolete ResolveNodeId method and implemented the new Resolve\n            method on OpcNodeId instead to determine the fully qualified node identifier using the\n            servers namespaces array on-demand. This does now support the node access using the\n            full qualified node identifier without the need to know the index of the dedicated\n            node namespace.\n* New       Implemented additional overload of UpdateCertificate method to manually define whether\n            a certificate is to be created in case the is a certificate missing or not valid. So\n            far this was only possible by using the static AutoCreateCertificate property.\n* New       Implemented new properties OpcClient.Certificate (to directly the define a custom\n            Client Certificate) and OpcClient.Security (to set-up Client security options within\n            one class.\n* Changed   Renamed property \"OpcSecurity.Policies\" to \"OpcSecurity.EndpointPolicies\" to match the\n            \"OpcClientSecurity.EndpointPolicy\" model.\n* Changed   Defined the default value of \"OpcCertificateManager.AutoCreateCertificate\" to true.\n* New       Implemented the new properties in Opc.UaFx.Server.OpcSecurity:\n            AutoAcceptUntrustedCertificates and AutoCreateCertificate.\n* New       Implemented new OpcServer.Certificate property to match the same API model as the\n            OpcClient implements.\n* Changed   Behaviour used to select an endpoint to connect to, to not longer to be negotiable in\n            case there is an explicit endpoint policy defined.\n* Changed   Default of AutoAcceptUntrustedCertificates in SecurityConfiguration to true.\n* New       Implemented support for a DefaultNodeManager - this is either the first manager in the\n            list of managers defined, or the internally defined default node manager which defines\n            the namespace as \"<serveraddress>/nodes/\". There is now also the possibility to define\n            just a callback method to provide the nodes for the default node managers\n            address space.\n* Moved     \"OpcClient.PreferredPolicy\" property to \"OpcClient.Security.EndpointPolicy\".\n* Moved     \"OpcClient.UseDomainChecks\" property to \"OpcClient.Security.VerifyServersCertificateDomains\"\n            and changed its default value to false.\n* Moved     \"OpcClient.UserIdentity\" property to \"OpcClient.Security.UserIdentity\" and changed\n            its type from the foundation type IUserIdentity to OpcUserIdentity.\n* Moved     \"OpcClient.UseOnlySecureEndpoints\" property to \"OpcClient.Security.UseOnlySecureEndpoints\"\n            and changed its default value to false.\n* Removed   Obsolete \"OpcClient.UseAutoNodeIdResolution\" property.\n* New       Reworked / Reviewed OpcIdentity derivates and defined the OpcCertificateIdentity,\n            OpcWindowsIdentity, OpcServerIdentity and OpcClientIdentity as new derivates of\n            OpcUserIdentity (so far they just used the OpcIdentity as their base class). Also\n            changed their construction behaviour to simplify the process of identity creation on\n            client and server side.\n* Fixed     OpcRequestType.Call has been defined as OpcRequestType.Cancel so far. This lead to a\n            non functional use of the OpcRequestType.Call, because it has then used like the\n            OpcRequestType.Cancel.\n* Removed   OpcCertificateManager.AutoCreateCertificate property, because it is now used per\n            instance using OpcClient.Security.AutoCreateCertificate or\n            OpcServer.Security.AutoCreateCertificate. Also these properties are by default set to\n            the value true.\n* Removed   OpcServer.Security.Owner property to reduce redudant reference information and\n            simplify API.\n* Renamed   \"Server.OpcSecurity\" to \"Server.OpcServerSecurity\".\n* Renamed   \"OpcServerSecurity.Anonymous\" to \"OpcServerSecurity.AnonymousAcl\"\n* Renamed   \"OpcServerSecurity.Certificate\" to \"OpcServerSecurity.CertificateAcl\"\n* Renamed   \"OpcServerSecurity.IssuedToken\" to \"OpcServerSecurity.IssuedTokenAcl\"\n* Renamed   \"OpcServerSecurity.UserName\" to \"OpcServerSecurity.UserNameAcl\"\n* Renamed   \"OpcClient.PreferredLocales\" to \"OpcClient.Locales\"\n* Renamed   \"OpcClient.ReceivedNotification\" to \"OpcClient.NotificationReceived\"\n* Renamed   \"OpcClient.OnReceivedNotification\" to \"OpcClient.OnNotificationReceived\"\n* Renamed   \"OpcSubscription.ReceivedNotification\" to \"OpcSubscription.NotificationReceived\"\n* Renamed   \"OpcSubscription.OnReceivedNotification\" to \"OpcSubscription.OnNotificationReceived\"\n* Moved     OpcNodeCommand from Opc.UaFx.Client to Opc.UaFx.Services.\n* Moved     OpcNodeAttributeCommand from Opc.UaFx.Client to Opc.UaFx.Services.\n* Renamed   \"OpcNodeCommand\" to \"OpcNodeServiceCommand\".\n* Renamed   \"OpcNodeAttributeCommand\" to \"OpcNodeAttributeServiceCommand\".\n* Renamed   OpcStatusCode members with \"Bad\", \"Good\" and \"Uncertain\" prefixes like the OPC \n            Foundation does use them to differ status codes into this three categories.\n* New       Implemented additional ReadNode overloads to define a numeric node identifier together\n            with a namespace index and attribute to read.\n* New       Implemented new ReadNodes methods to read multiple nodes using a specific attribute.\n\n= 07.02.2017 - V1.6.5.2 =\n* Changed   Removed implict interpretation of a numeric node identifier encoded as string.\n\n= 08.12.2016 - V1.6.5.1 =\n* New       Implemented enhanced timeout handling for read history requests produced by the\n            OpcClient. This is necessary to give the server additional time to collect the\n            historical data in case it will take more time as usual and the server does provide,\n            successive continuation points until the data collection has been completed.\n\n= 07.12.2016 - V1.6.5.0 =\n* New       Enhanced Node History Navigation in case of a fixed time window (there StartTime and\n            EndTime are not equals MinDate). So that node history values are collected on each\n            page request as long as the server provides a continuation point until either the\n            server does not longer provide a continuation point or the page has reached\n            its page size.\n\n= 12.10.2016 - V1.6.4.0 =\n* New       Updated IOpcNode interface definition under respect of the current public OpcNode API.\n* New       Implemented new method Children() : IEnumerable<IOpcNode> in IOpcNode to determine\n            physical childrens in the node tree.\n\n= 06.10.2016 - V1.6.3.0 =\n* New       Implemented the new method OpcFileMethods.IsFileNode to determine if a node is\n            accessible in the manner of a FileType.\n* Fixed     Out of memory issue when using OpcFile.ReadAllText and OpcFile.ReadAllLines.\n* New       Improved performance of OpcFile.ReadAllText to not longer construct the text using\n            the lines of the file, instead it uses now the binary stream of the file.\n* New       Generally optimized speed of reading and writing file contents by using the\n            client configured MaxByteStringLength.\n* Fixed     Issue when browsing nodes containing remote nodes which led to the exception:\n            'Cannot cast an absolute ExpandedNodeId to a NodeId. Use ExpandedNodeId.ToNodeId instead.'\n\n= 04.10.2016 - V1.6.2.0 =\n* New       Implemented new method CreateTempCertificate which is also used in cases there\n            AutoCreateCertificate is set to true and there the certificate generator utiltity is\n            not installed. So that there is no longer a need to have the certificate generator\n            utility besides OPC applications implemented for testing / development.\n* Fixed     Issue with opening files for writing - the access mask has been verified in\n            the wrong way.\n* New       Implemented new Session Resource Manager to dispose any session related resources\n            whenever a session times out or closes. Such a resource is the internal file handle\n            when accessing file nodes via OPC. In case there the client discards the connection to\n            the server upon any reason the Session Manager now releases all by the session\n            acquired resources.\n\n= 14.09.2016 - V1.6.1.0 =\n* New       Implemented OpcNodeManager.Browse method to support custom browsing in\n            subclassing scenarios.\n\n= 25.08.2016 - V1.6.0.0 =\n* New       Excluded non-value attribtues from automatically updating the source label of the\n            value when writing node values. Workarounds to use an explicit OpcValue are\n            now obsolete.\n* New       Introduced new derivate OpcBrowseNodeContext especially for node browsing and reduced\n            previous OpcNodeContext to a more generic implementation for further subclassing. The\n            new OpcBrowseNodeContext does now also include the node identifier of the node from\n            that the browsing operation has been originally introduced.\n* New       Introduced OpcValue.As<T> method to retrieve the represented value as a specific type\n            by converting the value to the type specified by T.\n* New       Implemented new OpcResult class to represent ServiceResult instancs.\n* New       Implemented subclass OpcMethodContext of OpcContext to determine method call sensitive\n            system information including the method node being call and its target. This does also\n            include storing the outcome of the callback routine invocation.\n* New       Implemented file system accessibility support for OpcFileNode objects from the client\n            point of view. This does include a simple 1:1 API layer implemented by the\n            OpcFileMethods class, a SafeOpcFileHandle to ensure allocated file handles are freed,\n            the OpcFile class to implement a OPC based System.IO.File class like set of service\n            methods, the OpcFileInfo class to implement a OPC based System.IO.FileInfo class like\n            object and the OpcFileStream class to implement a OPC based System.IO.FileStream like\n            object which is a derivate of the System.IO.Stream class and can therefore used by all\n            StreamReader and StreamWriter classes provided by the .NET Framework.\n* New       Implemented new OpcPropertyNode and OpcPropertyNode<T>.\n* Changed   The type OpcVariableValue does now require a generic type parameter for the type of\n            value represented. The OpcVariableNode class has been adopted regarding this\n            type parameter.\n* New       Implemented new OpcFileNode including its child nodes like the method nodes Open,\n            Close, GetPosition, SetPosition, Read and Write.\n\n= 28.07.2016 - V1.5.11.7 =\n* Fixed     Issue with remote node identifiers in OpcNodeId.\n* Fixed     Issue with comparing node identifiers of different types in OpcNodeId.\n\n= 17.06.2016 - V1.5.11.6 =\n* New       Implemented Child method on OpcNodeInfo to retrieve the successors of a node using\n            its OpcName. This does include the BrowseName, DisplayName and SymbolicName of a Node.\n* New       Implemented Parent method on OpcNodeInfo to retrieve the ancestors of a node using\n            its OpcName. This does include the BrowseName, DisplayName and SymbolicName of a Node.\n* New       Implemented Children method on OpcNodeInfo to retrieve successors of a node of a specific\n            OpcNodeCategory.\n* New       Implemented Parents method on OpcNodeInfo to retrieve ancestors of a node of a specific\n            OpcNodeCategory.\n\n= 13.06.2016 - V1.5.11.5 =\n* New       Implemented implicit cast operator for ExpandedNodeId's.\n* New       Implemented additional Get method overload on OpcNamespace to retrieve node namespaces\n            using an Uri and Index.\n* Fixed     Fixed issue with ExpandedNodeId's in OpcValue's and simplified handling of them.\n\n= 30.05.2016 - V1.5.11.4 =\n* New       Minimized lock conditions when reading/writing nodes.\n\n= 02.05.2016 - V1.5.11.3 =\n* New       Renewed demo license to provide new license period.\n\n= 18.04.2016 - V1.5.11.2 =\n* Fixed     Issue with monitored items when reading the initial value of a node (the server ran\n            into a NullReferenceException in case of non filtered monitored items).\n\n= 31.03.2016 - V1.5.11.1 =\n* New       Implemented Changed event on OpcStatus.\n* Fixed     Issue with not synchronized OPC Status from SDK to the foundation stack\n            (on OpcValue and OpcVariableNode).\n\n= 23.03.2016 - V1.5.11.0 =\n* New       OpcNamespace which represent the whole namespace information of an node identifier\n            (Namespace Index and Namespace Uri).\n* New       IOpcNamespaceResolver which is implemented by OpcNodeManager, OpcClient and OpcServer.\n            This interface does provide late bound namespace resolution after the OpcServer is\n            started or the OpcClient is connected. Each OpcNodeId its namespace has been resolved\n            does provide the fully qualified url the namespace together with the node identifier.\n* New       OpcNodeId.Namespace property to provide the associated OpcNamespace.\n* Changed   Renamed OpcAttribute.Historizing to OpcAttribute.IsHistorizing.\n* New       OpcNode: Implemented node change tracking through the properties HasPendingChanges\n            and PendingChanges including the method IsChangePending.\n* New       Implemented history support for OpcVariableNode and its subclasses.\n* New       Enhanced ctor overloads of OpcStatusCollection to much simpler setup a new instance\n            using OpcStatusCodes.\n* New       HDA methods on client to read and update node history.\n* New       HDA interface on server to provide the required logic to handle historical data access.\n* New       HDA services: IOpcReadNodesHistoryService and IOpcUpdateNodesHistoryService.\n* New       HDA commands: OpcCreateNodeHistory, OpcDeleteNodeHistory, OpcDeleteNodeHistoryAtTime,\n            OpcDeleteNodeHistoryModified, OpcReadNodeHistory, OpcReplaceNodeHistory and\n            OpcUpdateNodeHistory. All of them are subclasses of the OpcNodeHistoryCommand.\n\n= 03.02.2016 - V1.5.10.0 =\n* Added     OPC Watch application to assembly archive.\n\n= 25.01.2016 - V1.5.9.1 =\n* Fixed     Issue with wrong released session although it can be reused in case of an reconnect.\n\n= 21.01.2016 - V1.5.9.0 =\n* Fixed     Possible multi threading issues in session keep alive in OpcClient.\n* Changed   The BreakDetected event is now being raised only if the reconnect timeout is\n            equals zero.\n* Fixed     In case of releasing an OPC client session which has already been disposed of in\n            some cases it could lead to an undesired reconnect to the server upon a thrown\n            ObjectDisposedException by the already disposed client session.\n\n= 18.01.2016 - V1.5.8.0 =\n* New       Updated licensing logic.\n\n= 14.01.2016 - V1.5.7.1 =\n* Fixed     Issue with the minimum possible PublishingInterval in the OpcSubscription class.\n\n= 09.01.2016 - V1.5.7.0 =\n* Fixed     Issue with null reference exception in OpcCertificateManager.CreateCertificate\n            when passing an applicationUri as a null reference (Nothing in Visual Basic).\n* Fixed     Issue with non uniquely generated OpcNodeId's for InputArguments and OutputArguments\n            of OpcMethodNode instances. This lead to the behaviour that only the arguments of the\n            most recently provided OpcMethodNode was published when browsing / reading the\n            method argument properties.\n* Changed   The OpcNodeId for InputArgument and OutputArgument nodes of OpcMethodNode instances\n            for more information see the topic before.\n* Changed   The OpcReadOnlyNodeCollection class does now provide IOpcNode instances instead of\n            the internal foundation NodeState instances.\n* New       An OpcNodeId can now constructed from OpcName instances its SymbolicName is a null\n            reference (Nothing in Visual Basic). In this case the BrowseName is used instead of\n            the SymbolicName.\n* New       The OpcReadNodesRequest does now by default return both timestamps (source and server).\n* New       Implemented new OpcNodeManager methods: AddNode, RemoveNode and IsNodeAccessable.\n* Fixed     Issue with sometimes duplicate ACE's in case of requesting an ACE which has been already\n            added to an ACL.\n\n= 17.12.2015 - V1.5.6.8 =\n* Fixed     Issue with missed TimeStamp update on writing node values.\n* Fixed     Issue with missed TimeStamp data on reading node values.\n\n= 17.12.2015 - V1.5.6.7 =\n* New       Implemented ChangePassword method on OpcServerIdentity to change the user password\n            after an identity has been created.\n* New       Implemented protected SystemContext property on OpcNodeManager to provide an\n            alternative context within system internal changes can be performed.\n* New       The OpcWriteNode class does now automatically set the source label timestamp when\n            writing a node.\n* Changed   The OpcValueLabel is now not longer defined as a struct instead it is now a class.\n\n= 16.12.2015 -
