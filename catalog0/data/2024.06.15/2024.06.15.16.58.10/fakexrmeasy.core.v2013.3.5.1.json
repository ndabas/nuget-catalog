If you were accessing this property, please use the GetEntity or CreateQuery public methods in the IXrmFakedContext interface to query the state of the In-Memory database state instead. For any other use, always rely on the IOrganizationService* interfaces only. This breaking change will affect you only if you were accessing the 'Data' dictionary directly.\n- Fix Sonar Quality Gate settings: DynamicsValue/fake-xrm-easy#28\n## [3.1.2]\n- Bump dataverse dependency to production ready version 1.0.1\n## [3.1.1]\n### Changed\n- Limit FakeItEasy package dependency to v6.x versions - DynamicsValue/fake-xrm-easy#37\n- Updated build script to also include the major version in the Title property of the generated .nuspec file - DynamicsValue/fake-xrm-easy#41\n- Modified TopCount support in QueryByAttribute and QueryExpression, to not throw exception if PageInfo was set but empty: DynamicsValue/fake-xrm-easy#16\n- Do not clear previous FakeMessageExecutors or GenericFakeMessageExecutors when adding new ones or when calling them multiple times: DynamicsValue/fake-xrm-easy#15\n- Allow creating records with any statecode attribute, which will be overriden by the platform as Active - DynamicsValue/fake-xrm-easy#36\n- Both GetEntityById and GetEntityById&lt;T&gt; now clone the entity record before returning it - DynamicsValue/fake-xrm-easy#27\n## [3.1.0]\n### Changed\n- Added TopCount support in QueryByAttribute, and throw exception if both TopCount and PageInfo are set: DynamicsValue/fake-xrm-easy#16\n- Removed .netcoreapp3.1 target framework in versions 2.x, it'll be supported from versions 3.x onwards. Bump\n## [3.0.2]\n### Changed\n- Bump Dataverse dependency to 0.6.1 from 0.5.10 to solve DynamicsValue/fake-xrm-easy#20\n- Also replaced Microsoft.Dynamics.Sdk.Messages dependency, as it has also been deprecated by MSFT, to Microsoft.PowerPlatform.Dataverse.Client.Dynamics 0.6.1 DynamicsValue/fake-xrm-easy#20\n## [3.0.1-rc1] - Initial release",
