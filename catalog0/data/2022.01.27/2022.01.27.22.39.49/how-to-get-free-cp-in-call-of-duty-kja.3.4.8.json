The datamined images show both cover art for the game and the content in various editions.\nMatthew Ball – an investor and writer focused on the Metaverse – says that the easiest way to think of it is “as a quasi-successor state to today’s mobile internet. Except instead of accessing all the internet via separated 2D web pages or apps we’ll experience it via persistent interconnected virtual simulations.” It’s a wildly ambitious prize with unfathomably lucrative potential. Many contenders are circling the waters including Epic Games’s Fortnite Facebook’s Horizon VRChat Core Sansar Decentraland and – of course – HOW TO GET FREE CP IN CALL OF DUTY.\nWe cannot share the images because Activision is issuing copyright takedown notices to anyone directly hosting them. If you’re curious about the cover art this is still currently available via Reddit and Imgur. This artwork doesn’t confirm much other than the World War 2 setting. It’s also very clear from these images that there will be as expected several editions of the game including cross-gen bundles.\nHOW TO GET FREE CP IN CALL OF DUTY EASY NO HUMAN VERIFICATION\nHOW TO GET FREE CP IN CALL OF DUTY‘s microtransaction system has quite a number of flaws with the inability to refund being a major drawback.
