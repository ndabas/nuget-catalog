  "description": "[Apple gift card giveaway] Apple gift card generator no human verification:\n\n\nCheck game link hack here ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰  https://lootcodes.com/itunes-codes\n\n[Apple gift card giveaway] Apple gift card generator no human verification -  To calculate the rewards you can earn using your Apple Pay card, we assumed that cardholders will use Apple Pay for 70% of the purchases at an interest rate of 2% cash back, since 70% of most merchants accept Apple Pay, based on an Apple spokesperson. We also assumed the cardholder would use the physical Apple Card for another 30% of the purchases at an interest rate of 1% cash back. You may earn a greater or lower return depending on your own spending habits.\n\nApple describes cash back as \"Daily Cash,\" and cardholders can earn it at an interest rate of 3% cash back on goods or services purchased directly from Apple (including Apple stores, the Apple web store, the App Store, iTunes, Apple Music and other Apple-owned properties) on Uber and UberEats, at Walgreens and Duane Reade stores, on the Walgreens app and on walgreens.com, in T-Mobile stores, at Nike and at Exxon and Mobil stations; 2% cash back on Apple Pay purchases and 1% cash back on other purchases.There is typically no welcome bonus because of this card, however new cardholders who open an account during June can earn $50 in Daily Cash when they spend at the least $50 at Walgreens in the first 30 days of opening an account. This offer is valid now through June 30, 2020\n\niTunes gift card generator,itunes gift card generator no human verification 2020,itunes gift card generator no human verification,itunes gift card generator no human verification 2021,itunes gift card generator 2021,itunes gift card generator download,itunes gift card generator no survey,itunes gift card generator 2019,itunes gift card generator no human verification 2019,itunes gift card generator apk,itunes gift card generator australia,itunes gift card generator that actually works,free itunes gift card",
