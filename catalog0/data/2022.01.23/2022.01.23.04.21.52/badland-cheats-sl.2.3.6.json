This applies to all platforms including PC Android and Xbox. However there is a way to change your username and get the most out of the game for your money at the same time.\nCharge for skill passes in our games– Going back to creating our own game within BADLAND we can elevate the experience an additional notch by designing special abilities characters and more that are only available if visiting players pay a certain price. This may be a better idea than charging an initial ticket to access the game.\nRichard Bartle – a senior lecturer in computer game design at the University of Essex where in 1978 he created the Multi-User Dungeon a text-based game credited with being the first-ever virtual world – is unconvinced that experiencing media and meeting other avatars inside game worlds can be interpreted as the inception of a Metaverse. “Yes you can [do those things]. But why would you” he says matter-of-factly. “In pandemic times it's easy to say that: ‘You can go online and watch movies with your mates!’ But why would I need to go online when I can just watch it on my television which is much bigger – and doesn't have little [avatars] anywhere”\n",
