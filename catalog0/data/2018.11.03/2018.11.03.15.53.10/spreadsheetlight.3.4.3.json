  "releaseNotes": "You can read the full list of changes at http://spreadsheetlight.com/version-history/ Note that source code is only available up to minor releases, meaning Major.Minor.0 versions.\n\nVersion 3.4.3\n- Bug fix: Cell value/formula set on a shared cell formula base cell now works correctly. For example, setting on C3 when C3 holds a shared cell formula will work.\n- Bug fix: Setting filter on worksheet now works correctly. It failed to sort before (basically also need to set underlying defined name _xlnm._FilterDatabase. Gawdiggitty.)\n\nVersion 3.4.2\n- You can now get row/column grouping levels. See GetRowGroupLevel() and GetColumnGroupLevel() functions.\n- You can now get a list of the shared cell formulas in the currently selected worksheet. See GetSharedCellFormulas() function.\n- Cell formulas are now more correctly maintained when copying/inserting/deleting cells/rows/columns.\n- Catered for situation where cell reference ranges aren't in top-left to bottom-right format (such as E1:A7). See SLTool for translating reference sequences to SLCellPointRange and vice versa. Don't worry, you probably wouldn't have known about this anyway...\n- You can now draw borders on a cell range! And border grids! Try out the DrawBorder() and DrawBorderGrid() functions.\n- You can now merge cells and set style/border properties at the same time! No more manual border drawing on merged cells! Woohoo! See MergeWorksheetCells() function overloads.\n- You can now make SpreadsheetLight throw up, I mean, throw exceptions! When there are exceptions, of course. See ThrowExceptionsIfAny property. Not sure how much help this is though...\n- You can now forcibly get a boolean value if it looks like it's a boolean but actually stored as text. See the GetCellValueAsBoolean() functions.\n- Breaking change: SLCellFormula.Reference data type changed from string to List<SLCellPointRange> (but you shouldn't have been using this anyway...)\n- Bug fix: The properties \"count\" and \"uniqueCount\" removed from shared strings table part. It seems a high number of shared strings will cause the calculation to render a corrupt file. See when writing the shared strings table for details.\n- Bug fix: Outline (grouping) levels of rows and columns now limited to 0 to 7 (was allowed to go to 8 previously. See GroupRows() and GroupColumns() in RowColumnFunctions.cs)\n\nVersion 3.4.1\n- Removed optional argument use (specifically IsStylish) so that developers using Visual Studio 2008 (.NET Framework 3.5) can still compile the source code.\n- Optimised GetWorksheetStatistics(). It's now faster and less memory intensive.\n- Bug fix: autofitting rows with a smaller initial height now correctly autofit to content\n- Bug fix (?): SLStyle.MergeStyle() now takes on the new style object's format code regardless.",
