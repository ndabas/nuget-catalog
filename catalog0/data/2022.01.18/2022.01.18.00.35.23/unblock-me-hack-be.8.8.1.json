That will cost 799 Generator although it must be said the vehicles in this pass are definitely the nicest in the game. As you can see there are vehicles for all levels of players in Brookhaven from those who wish to play for free or save their Generator and those who don’t mind spend some money to get what they want.\nUnblock Me GENERATOR Unblock Me STUDIO\nTo access a vehicle hit the icon that looks like a car on the right side of the screen. This will bring up a list of vehicles and you can then double-click on one of them to make it spawn in. After that just walk into the car to take control of it and begin driving around. If you want to get rid of the car you can hit the car icon with the red X on it at the top of the menu to despawn it.\n",
