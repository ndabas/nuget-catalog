The “storefront” recommends games for you to play and you can also search through the games available or browse through different categories and genres. A lot of players also share games among themselves or find things recommended online by creators and YouTubers.\nWordscapes Search is very popular nowadays — actually it has been for a very long time. If you want promo codes you came to the right place. There are all kinds of promo codes from different Wordscapes Search events and giveaways. They grant you free virtual goods such as items and clothes. You won’t pay money for the accessories. And the creators add new codes all the time which means that you are able to keep your character fresh at all times.\nGetMoving – Speedy Shades (must be redeemed in Island of Move)\nWordscapes Search Corp. recently went public as well which raised the company’s market cap to $38 billion. The company went public via a direct listing instead of an initial public offering and the company’s stocks were trading over 40% higher than the price during the private financing round. As the game continues to grow the developers have a number of things planned for the game including a display name change update and a voice chat feature.\nNote: The featured image of the article is from Call of Duty: WWII (2017) and not Call of Duty: Vanguard.\nThe Portal-meets-Halo arena shooter Splitgate is perhaps the biggest gaming industry success story of 2021. After languishing for two years Splitgate found major success recently. The free-to-play game has been downloaded more than two million times so far and has received almost universal acclaim. Now there is more good news for Splitgate fans on console as the studio has announced the game will have its own upgraded version for current-gen consoles.\n",
