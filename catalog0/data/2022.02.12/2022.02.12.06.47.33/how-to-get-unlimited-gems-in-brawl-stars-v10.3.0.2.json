In recent months, players have seen Volley Brawl, Basket Brawl, and Showdown +.

Teams of three must work together to collect the most purple gems, which spawn in the center of the map every few seconds. Players must target the enemy brawler with the most gems in order to steal them and take the lead. Once one team has collectively accumulated 10 gems, the 15-second count down begins and players must run to safety whilst protecting their teammates.\n\nUsing iFile or Filza, browse to where you saved the downloaded .deb file and tap on it.
