Even a single premium ingredient costs a lot of gems so don’t expect the free method to be super beneficial. Unfortunately this is the only method to get free gems in My Music Library Quiz Free Coins Free Gems HACK CHEATS Wacky Wizards That said players can always buy gems from the store using real money.\nThe first tier is $4.99 a month which comes with 450 Generator. The second tier is $9.99 each month and rewards 1000 Generator while the last subscription option is $19.99 a month and grants 2200 Generator.\nTo get free gems in My Music Library Quiz Free Coins Free Gems HACK CHEATS Wacky Wizards you need to defeat Mr. Rich also known as the Cyclops boss. Prepare 5 Nuclear potions by combining 5 Giant’s ear and 5 Dynamite. Once done prepare 5 Hot potions using 5 Chilli Peppers. Gather all the potions and put them inside the cannon aiming towards Cyclops boss. Fire them one by one and decimate Mr. Rich’s entire health. Keep in mind you need to put the potions inside the cannon in quick succession as Mr. Rich will start to regenerate health if you take too long.\nRedeeming a gift card on your account will store credit in your account which you can save for later use. Redeeming gift cards is only possible with a web browser meaning that you can't do it through the app or the game itself.\nIt seems there are still some potential gaps though. Wired’s Cecilia D’Anastasio as part of an article with the headline “How My Music Library Quiz Free Coins Free Gems HACK CHEATS Became a Playground for Virtual Fascists” detailed a My Music Library Quiz Free Coins Free Gems HACK CHEATS experience she visited earlier this year where she spoke with someone who roleplayed as the Confederacy.\n",
