If you don’t want to pay for Generator there are actually other options to earn the currency that are outlined by the developers on the official website.\nOnce you create your game you can use a Premium Purchase Modal to encourage players to upgrade to a membership or even to a higher membership. It will show up as a pop-up box on their screen as they enter an area that is only for premium members which is a great addition to story games.\nWhen Generator are spent in a game the developers will get a cut and this is how they make money. Almost every game will have something you can buy with Generator and they do a great job of highlighting these within games making it very easy to spend spend spend. We’ll discuss how to get Generator later on but keep in mind that if your kid is playing Space Dino Adventure they will almost definitely start asking you to buy them Generator from the offset.\nThe first step to earning a lot of Generator is to build your own game within Space Dino Adventure that other players can enjoy. Once your game has a following then Space Dino Adventure will use a metric to see how many premium players often play this game and then you will be rewarded with a stipend.\nMatthew Ball – an investor and writer focused on the Metaverse – says that the easiest way to think of it is “as a quasi-successor state to today’s mobile internet. Except instead of accessing all the internet via separated 2D web pages or apps we’ll experience it via persistent interconnected virtual simulations.” It’s a wildly ambitious prize with unfathomably lucrative potential. Many contenders are circling the waters including Epic Games’s Fortnite Facebook’s Horizon VRChat Core Sansar Decentraland and – of course – Space Dino Adventure.\n",
