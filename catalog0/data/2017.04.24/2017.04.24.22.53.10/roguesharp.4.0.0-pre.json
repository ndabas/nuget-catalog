  "description": "A portable class library for roguelike developers to provide utilities frequently used in roguelikes or 2D tile based games. Inspired by libtcod\n\n    New features:\n       * Optimized cave map generator (Thanks to James Neal)\n       * Optimized DijkstraShortestPath.FindPath method (Thanks to flend for this update)\n       * Multiple new \"Try\" methods which return null instead of throwing exceptions\n       * Diagonal paths can be found by using new constructors on GoalMap and PathFinder\n       * Map.GetCellsInCircle and Map.GetBorderCellsInCircle to get cells within a circular radius\n    Breaking changes:\n       * Point and Rectangle classes are now structs (Thanks to James Neal)\n       * Updated all appropriate references to Cell with ICell (Thanks to Courtney Strachan)\n       * Map.ComputeFov and Map.AppendFov both return a ReadonlyCollection of ICell instead void\n       * The Path returned from PathFinder.ShortestPath now includes the source cell in the returned Path \n       * Map.GetCellsInArea was renamed to Map.GetCellsInSquare\n       * Map.GetCellsInRadius was renamed to Map.GetCellsInDiamond",
