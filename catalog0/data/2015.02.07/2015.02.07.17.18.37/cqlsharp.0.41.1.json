  "description": "CqlSharp is a high performance, asynchronous Cassandra CQL binary protocol client implementing the ADO.NET data provider interfaces.\n\n      It's main features are:\n      * The API implements the ADO.NET interfaces. If you are familiar with SqlConnection, SqlCommand, and SqlReader, you should be able to use CqlSharp with no difficulty.\n      * CqlSharp is an implementation of the CQL Binary Protocols v1, v2, and v3 and therefore requires Cassandra 1.2 and up\n      * CqlSharp supports all the binary protocol v2 features: batching, paging, bound query variables, result schema caching, check-and-set (CAS) statements, and sasl-authentication\n      * CqlSharp supports all the binary protocol v3 features: more queries per connection, timestamp property, UDT and Tuple types, larger collections\n      * Supports fast mapping of objects to query parameters, or query results to objects. Mapping is tunable by decorating your classes via Table and Column attributes.\n      * Extremely fast, highly flexible and extendable type (conversion) system. Automatically converts parameters and results to the requested types.\n      * Query tracing, timeouts and cancellation is supported\n      * Configuration is done through connection strings. The simultaneous use of multiple Cassandra clusters is supported.\n      * Extensive logging, including support for custom logger implementations\n\n      See https://github.com/reuzel/CqlSharp/wiki/Features for an extensive feature list.",

  "releaseNotes": "## Version 0.41.1 CqlDataReader bug fix\n      * Fix: make sure latest value is deserialized in Current property of CqlDataReader{T}\n      * Fix: remove redundant logging when PartitionAwareStrategy is used\n\n      ## Version 0.41.0 Array support and Node restart fixes\n      * Fix: Solve issue where CqlSharp can't reconnect when a Cassandra node is restarted\n      * Improved type system: support for arrays in value conversion (from/to list types)\n      * adding IsEqual to CqlColumnInfo to compare column values of two entities\n      \n      ## Version 0.40.1 - Fix CqlConnection.Open retry bug\n      * Solves issue with connection to 2.0.x and 1.x clusters when MaxQueryRetries=0\n      * Retries CqlConnection.Open up to MaxQueryRetries + 1, when opening connections to the cluster fails\n\n      ## Version 0.40.0 - Cassandra 2.1, binary protocol v3 and new type system\n      * Implements binary protocol v3: more queries per connection, timestamp property, UDT and Tuple types, larger collections.\n      * Added high performance and extremely flexible type conversion that prevents boxing, and even converts collection types (e.g. hashset{int} to list{long})\n      * Implemented DbDataReader.GetFieldValue{T}(int i)\n      * Supports User Defined Types. Annotate your class with CqlUserType and CqlColumn to have it correctly mapped to a Cassandra User Defined Type\n      * Guesses protocol version from release_version shortening connection setup times for older clusters\n\n      ...\n\n      See https://github.com/reuzel/CqlSharp/blob/master/ChangeLog.md for the full changelog.",
