  "releaseNotes": "v2.2.0 (Released May 4th, 2018)\nNew Functions\n1. Play the audio effect in the channel\nAdded a publish parameter in the playEffect method, to enable the remote user in the channel to hear the audio effect played locally. For details, see the description for playEffect in Voice Call API.\n\nNote\n\nIf your SDK is upgraded to v2.2 from a previous version, pay attention to the function changes of this API.\n\n2. Deploy the proxy at the server\nAgora provides a proxy package for enterprise users with corporate firewalls to deploy before accessing the services of Agora. For details, see Advanced: Deploying the Enterprise Proxy.\n\nImprovements\n1. Audio volume indication\nImproved the enableAudioVolumeIndication function. The method, once enabled, sends the audio volume indication of the speaker in its callback at set intervals, regardless of whether any user is speaking in the channel.\n\n2. Network quality detection during a session\nTo meet the customers’ need for real-time network quality detection in the channel, the onNetworkQuality method improved its data accuracy. For details, see the description for onNetworkQuality in Voice Call API.\n\n3. Lastmile quality detection before joining a channel\nTo test if the customers’ network condition can support voice or video calls before joining the channel, onLastmileQuality changed the detection from a fixed bitrate to the bitrate set by the customer in videoProfile to improve data accuracy. When the network condition is unknown, this callback is still triggered at two second intervals. For details, see the description for onLastmileQuality in Voice Call API.\n\n4. Audio Quality Enhancement\nImproved the audio quality in music playback scenarios. To achieve high-fidelity music playback, you can set Scenario：AgoraAudioScenarioGameStreaming = 3 in the setAudioProfile API. For details, see description for setAudioProfile in Voice Call API.\n\n5. Bitcode support\nAdded support for Bitcode, which enables app optimization and thinning by the App Store. The package size of the Bitcode SDK is 2.5 times that of the normal one.\n\nIssues Fixed\nFixed occasional echo issues caused by some iOS devices.\nFixed occasional screen display abnormalities when a large number of audience joins a host in a live-broadcast channel.\n\nKnown Issues and Limitations\nTo use the startAudioMixing API, ensure that the iOS device is 8.0 or later.\nEncryption does not interoperate with the Web SDK (based on Web RTC).\nBluetooth on iPhone 8 is not supported.\nNote\n\nThe security keys are improved and updated in v2.1.0. If you are using an Agora SDK version earlier than v2.1.0 and wish to migrate to the latest version, see Token Migration Guide.\n\norigin: https://docs.agora.io/en/2.2/product/Voice/Product%20Overview/release_ios_audio",
