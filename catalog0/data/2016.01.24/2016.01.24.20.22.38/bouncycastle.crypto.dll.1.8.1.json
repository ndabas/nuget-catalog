  "description": "Here at the Bouncy Castle, we believe in encryption. That's something that's near and dear to our hearts. We believe so strongly in encryption, that we've gone to the effort to provide some for everybody, and we've now been doing it for over 15 years!\n    The Bouncy Castle Crypto APIs are looked after by an Australian Charity, the Legion of the Bouncy Castle Inc., which looks after the care and feeding of the Bouncy Castle APIs. If you would like to help support this effort please see our donations page or purchase a support contract through Crypto Workshop. Requests to sponsor specific work on the APIs are also most welcome.",
