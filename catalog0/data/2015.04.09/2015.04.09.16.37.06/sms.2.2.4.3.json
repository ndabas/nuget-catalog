  "description": "A simple library for sending transactional messages.\n\n            This library contains the core code without any hard dependencies.\n\n            There are three layers:\n            * Messaging - defines a message, a sending interface and a recieving interface. Also contains a factory to build senders and receieves\n            * Routing - Allows services to send messages to named services (so clients dont need to know the protocol, port address username, password etc. of where the actual service is running)\n            * Services - Builds on the routing and adds typed messages with serialization support.",
