It allows specifying notes and comments look and layouting during document export.\n\nNotesCommentsLayoutingOptions property is of type INotesCommentsLayoutingOptions that has the following properties:\n\nNotesPositions NotesPosition - Gets or sets the position of the notes on the page.\nCommentsPositions CommentsPosition - Gets or sets the position of the comments on the page.\nColor CommentsAreaColor - Gets or sets the color of comments area.\nint CommentsAreaWidth - Gets or sets the width of the comments area in pixels.\n\nNotesPosition property is of type NotesPositions that is enumeration and has three members:\n\nNone - Specifies that notes should not be displayed at all.\nBottomFull - Specifies that notes should be fully displayed using additional pages as it is needed.\nBottomTruncated - Specifies that notes should be displayed in only one page.\n\nCommentsPosition property is of type CommentsPosition that is enumeration and has three members:\n\nNone - Specifies that comments should not be displayed at all.\nBottom - Specifies that comments should be displayed using additional pages, following the page of the slide.\nRight - Specifies that comments should be displayed to the right of the page.\n\nNotesPosition and CommentsPosition properties have values None by default.\n\nFor example, the following code allows exporting presentation to PDF document with comments placed right and truncated notes (shown only on first page).\n\nusing (Presentation presentation = new Presentation(\"Presentation.pptx\"))\n{\n    PdfOptions opt = new PdfOptions();\n    opt.NotesCommentsLayouting.NotesPosition = NotesPositions.BottomTruncated;\n    opt.NotesCommentsLayouting.CommentsPosition = CommentsPositions.Right;\n    presentation.Save(\"PresOut.pdf\", SaveFormat.Pdf, opt);\n}\n\nThe following code allows changing default color of comments area and the width of comments area:\n\nusing (Presentation presentation = new Presentation(\"comments.pptx\"))\n{\n    PdfOptions opt = new PdfOptions();\n    opt.NotesCommentsLayouting.NotesPosition = NotesPositions.BottomTruncated;\n    opt.NotesCommentsLayouting.CommentsPosition = CommentsPositions.Right;\n    opt.NotesCommentsLayouting.CommentsAreaWidth = 300;\n    opt.NotesCommentsLayouting.CommentsAreaColor = Color.Azure;\n    presentation.Save(\"PresOut.pdf\", SaveFormat.Pdf, opt);\n}\n\nElements SwfNotes, TiffNotes, HtmlNotes and PdfNotes of SaveFormat enumeration and property IncludeComments of SwfOptions, TiffOptions, HtmlOptions and PdfOptions are obsolete now.\n\nPay attention, NotesCommentsLayouting.NotesPosition has no effect when you use obsolete elements of SaveFormat. And if you use obsolete property IncludeComments of SwfOptions, TiffOptions, HtmlOptions or PdfOptions classes then NotesCommentsLayouting.CommentsPosition, NotesCommentsLayouting.CommentsAreaWidth and NotesCommentsLayouting.CommentsAreaColor have no effect too.\n\n\n=Possibility to export a presentation to a set of Bitmap objects\n\nAll added methods accept an object of type INotesCommentsLayoutingOptions, which allows to specify look and layouting of notes and comments in received Bitmap objects.\n\nThe following methods have been added to the Presentation class and the IPresentation interface:\n\nBitmap[] GetThumbnails(INotesCommentsLayoutingOptions notesCommentsLayouting);\nBitmap[] GetThumbnails(INotesCommentsLayoutingOptions notesCommentsLayouting, int[] slides);\nBitmap[] GetThumbnails(INotesCommentsLayoutingOptions notesCommentsLayouting, float scaleX, float scaleY);\nBitmap[] GetThumbnails(INotesCommentsLayoutingOptions notesCommentsLayouting, int[] slides, float scaleX, float scaleY);\nBitmap[] GetThumbnails(INotesCommentsLayoutingOptions notesCommentsLayouting, Size imageSize);\nBitmap[] GetThumbnails(INotesCommentsLayoutingOptions notesCommentsLayouting, int[] slides, Size imageSize);\n\nThe following examples allows getting a set of Bitmap objects for all existing slides with the arrangement of comments on the right, including full notes.\n\nusing (Presentation presentation = new Presentation(\"comments.pptx\"))\n{\n    NotesCommentsLayoutingOptions options = new NotesCommentsLayoutingOptions();\n    options.CommentsPosition = CommentsPositions.Right;\n    options.NotesPosition = NotesPositions.BottomFull;\n\n    Bitmap[] bmps = presentation.GetThumbnails(options);\n}\n\nTo obtain an image of a specific slide, for example, slides 2 and 7, without displaying comments and with notes truncated to the size of the page, you can use the following code.\n\nusing (Presentation presentation = new Presentation(\"comments.pptx\"))\n{\n    NotesCommentsLayoutingOptions options = new NotesCommentsLayoutingOptions();\n    options.NotesPosition = NotesPositions.BottomTruncated;\n\n    Bitmap[] bmps = presentation.GetThumbnails(options, new int[] { 2, 7 });\n}\n\nThe following methods have been added to the Slides class and ISlides interface:\n\nBitmap GetThumbnail(INotesCommentsLayoutingOptions notesCommentsLayouting);\nBitmap GetThumbnail(INotesCommentsLayoutingOptions notesCommentsLayouting, float scaleX, float scaleY);\nBitmap GetThumbnail(INotesCommentsLayoutingOptions notesCommentsLayouting, Size imageSize);\nvoid RenderToGraphics(INotesCommentsLayoutingOptions notesCommentsLayouting, Graphics graphics, int width, int height);\nvoid RenderToGraphics(INotesCommentsLayoutingOptions notesCommentsLayouting, Graphics graphics, float scale);\nvoid RenderToGraphics(INotesCommentsLayoutingOptions notesCommentsLayouting, Graphics graphics);\n\nTo get an image of the third presentation slide with the comments displayed on the right, you can use the following code:\n\nusing (Presentation presentation = new Presentation(\"comments.pptx\"))\n{\n    NotesCommentsLayoutingOptions options = new NotesCommentsLayoutingOptions();\n    options.CommentsPosition = CommentsPositions.Right;\n\n    Bitmap bmp = presentation.Slides[2].GetThumbnail(options);\n}\n\nNote that the GetThumbnail and RenderToGraphics methods of the Slide class can throw an exception of type InvalidOperationException if the NotesCommentsLayouting.NotesPosition property takes the value NotesPositions.BottomFull. This is due to the fact that when you send NotesCommentsLayouting.NotesPosition, which has the value NotesPositions.BottomFull, the notes may be too long and go beyond the page.\n\nMethods RenderToGraphics (bool withNotes, Graphics graphics, int width, int height), RenderToGraphics (bool withNotes, Graphics graphics, float scale) and RenderToGraphics (bool withNotes, Graphics graphics) of the Slides class and methods GetThumbnail (float scaleX, float scaleY), GetThumbnail (Size imageSize) of the NotesSlide class are marked as obsolete now.\n\n\n=Property Paragraph.EndParagraphPortionFormat has been added\n\nA new property EndParagraphPortionFormat has been added. This property specifies the portion properties that are to be used if another portion is inserted after the last one.\n\nIParagraph paragraph = autoShape.TextFrame.Paragraphs0;\nIPortionFormat endParaPortionFormat = paragraph.EndParagraphPortionFormat;",
