  "description": "This is a nice little command line parser based on Ray Hayes codeproject article Automatic Command Line Parsing in C#. I have adapted it to VB.NET and upgraded it to .NET 3.5.\n\n      An updated command line parser that has a built in commanding architecture. The usage varies depending on what you are trying to achieve, but you can have commands, nested commands and delegate commands.\n\n      You just add this assembly to your project and adda bunch of command objects...\n\n      note: From this version you have to set \"DefaultCommandAction\" on the constructor for the CommandCollection to \"Loop\" in order to stay in the application.",
