  "description": "Magikarp jump diamonds hack cheats:\n\nHACK HERE >>>> https://fabgames.xyz/magikarp-jump\n\nMagikarp as one of the strongest pokemons, in facts, it's even considered whilst the weakest pokemon in the whole series. That being said, besides the move “Splash”, which does literally no harm to the opponents, you can only unlock “Tackle” in your Magikarp when it reaches level 15. Hence, it wouldn't sound right to have a game designed for the weakest pokemon in the franchise.\n\nHowever, don't be fooled by its look, with enough determination and affection from the trainer, you can turn your Magikarp into a real beast. And that's just what you'll do in Pokemon Magikarp Jump. Become the world most capable Pokemon trainer and give your Magikarp incredible training to produce him stronger.In this game you will attempt yourself in the role of catcher Pokemon, but unusual, and water. Go fishing and make an effort to catch the strongest and rare carp. Train, catch more, boost your skills and fight with the very best catchers. Prove that carp is effective at something, make a furor for the catchers!\n\nMagikarp jump hack, Magikarp jump hack apk, Magikarp jump cheats, Magikarp jump hack apk, Magikarp jump hack no survey, Magikarp jump hack no human verification, Magikarp jump hack free download, Magikarp jump hack mod apk, Magikarp jump hack cheats",
