  "releaseNotes": "[buffer]: (Breaking) Removed both 'raw' and 'raws' encoding types from Buffer, these have been deprecated for a long time (Sakthipriyan Vairamani) #2859.\n\n[console]: (Breaking) Values reported by console.time() now have 3 decimals of accuracy added (Michaël Zasso) #3166.\n\n[fs]:\n - fs.readFile*(), fs.writeFile*(), and fs.appendFile*() now also accept a file descriptor as their first argument (Johannes Wüller) #3163.\n - (Breaking) In fs.readFile(), if an encoding is specified and the internal toString() fails the error is no longer thrown but is passed to the callback (Evan Lucas) #3485.\n - (Breaking) In fs.read() (using the fs.read(fd, length, position, encoding, callback) form), if the internal toString() fails the error is no longer thrown but is passed to the callback (Evan Lucas) #3503.\n\n[http]:\n - Fixed a bug where pipelined http requests would stall (Fedor Indutny) #3342.\n - (Breaking) When parsing HTTP, don't add duplicates of the following headers: Retry-After, ETag, Last-Modified, Server, Age, Expires. This is in addition to the following headers which already block duplicates: Content-Type, Content-Length, User-Agent, Referer, Host, Authorization, Proxy-Authorization, If-Modified-Since, If-Unmodified-Since, From, Location, Max-Forwards (James M Snell) #3090.\n - (Breaking) The callback argument to OutgoingMessage#setTimeout() must be a function or a TypeError is thrown (James M Snell) #3090.\n - (Breaking) HTTP methods and header names must now conform to the RFC 2616 \"token\" rule, a list of allowed characters that excludes control characters and a number of separator characters. Specifically, methods and header names must now match /^[a-zA-Z0-9_!#$%&'*+.^`|~-]+$/ or a TypeError will be thrown (James M Snell) #2526.\n\n[node]:\n - (Breaking) Deprecated the _linklist module (Rich Trott) #3078.\n - (Breaking) Removed require.paths and require.registerExtension(), both had been previously set to throw Error when accessed (Sakthipriyan Vairamani) #2922.\n\n[npm]: Upgraded to version 3.3.6 from 2.14.7, see https://github.com/npm/npm/releases/tag/v3.3.6 for more details. This is a major version bump for npm and it has seen a significant amount of change. Please see the original npm v3.0.0 release notes for a list of major changes (Rebecca Turner) #3310.\n\n[src]: (Breaking) Bumped NODE_MODULE_VERSION to 47 from 46, this is necessary due to the V8 upgrade. Native add-ons will need to be recompiled (Rod Vagg) #3400.\n\n[timers]: Attempt to reuse the timer handle for setTimeout().unref(). This fixes a long-standing known issue where unrefed timers would perviously hold beforeExit open (Fedor Indutny) #3407.\n\n[tls]:\n - Added ALPN Support (Shigeki Ohtsu) #2564.\n - TLS options can now be passed in an object to createSecurePair() (Коренберг Марк) #2441.\n - (Breaking) The default minimum DH key size for tls.connect() is now 1024 bits and a warning is shown when DH key size is less than 2048 bits. This a security consideration to prevent \"logjam\" attacks. A new minDHSize TLS option can be used to override the default. (Shigeki Ohtsu) #1831.\n\n[util]:\n - (Breaking) util.p() was deprecated for years, and has now been removed (Wyatt Preul) #3432.\n - (Breaking) util.inherits() can now work with ES6 classes. This is considered a breaking change because of potential subtle side-effects caused by a change from directly reassigning the prototype of the constructor using ctor.prototype = Object.create(superCtor.prototype, { constructor: { ... } }) to using Object.setPrototypeOf(ctor.prototype, superCtor.prototype) (Michaël Zasso) #3455.\n\n[v8]: (Breaking) Upgraded to 4.6.85.25 from 4.5.103.35 (Ali Ijaz Sheikh) #3351.\n - Implements the spread operator, see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_operator for further information.\n - Implements new.target, see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/new.target for further information.\n\n[zlib]: Decompression now throws on truncated input (e.g. unexpected end of file) (Yuval Brik) #2595.",
