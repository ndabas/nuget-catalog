Will be removed in 17.12 release.\nNew API related to the BLOBs management has been added\n\nNew BLOBs API\n\nOverview\n\nA Binary Large Object (BLOB) is a binary data stored as a single entity, that must be handled in a special way because of its size. It cannot be considered that any BLOB object may fit in the process's memory - or, even if it can, it may lead to an issues like undesirable high memory consumption or increase the chances of \"out of memory\" exceptions, and other inappropriate effects.\nPresentaion can be considered as BLOB itself or can contain BLOBs - such as large video or audio files. To prevent unwanted memory consumption and other issues a new BLOBs management functionality was introduced.\n\nThe way to avoid BLOBs loading into memory is to use streams - the instances of classes inherited from the base Stream class. A new functions were added to the public API to support passing streams as arguments - to treat these streams as BLOBs and guarantee that no process's memory will be wasted to store them.\n\nWhat is important about streams is who owns them. As an example, you may open the FileStream and pass this stream to Presentation's instance. You may want to delete this file later, while the Presentation's instance is still here - but if it is deleted, how will this instance use it to save the presentation in the other format, for example?\n\nTo solve this possible conflict an idea of \"possession\" of the stream was introduced. When you pass a stream to Presentation, you may choose the behavior the most suitable for you - either let Presentation lock the stream and use it later or read the whole stream and then release it. Under the hood a different techniques might be used to handle large streams - including copying the whole stream in a temporary file and cleanup later when Presentation's instance will be disposed. Obviously, passing the stream to Presentation and let it be locked is more effective and not introduce an overhead related to the file system operations, but it may be inappropriate if you can't let this stream be locked and want close it before Presentation's instance will be disposed. So here the choice is up to the Presentation's instance owner.\nPresentation source locking behavior\n\nThe source of the presentation is the data from which this presentation will be loaded and an instance of the Presentation class will be created. It can be a file or an instance of the Stream. There're two options that can be selected for the Presentation construction - they represented by PresentationLockingBehavior enumeration members.\n\nLoadAndRelease - the source will be released immediately after Presentation's object will be constructed. If usage of the temporary files is disabled (IBlobManagementOptions.IsTemporaryFilesAllowed is set to false), the whole presentation will be loaded into memory.\n\nKeepLocked - the source (file or Stream) will be locked. One of the major property of streams is that they might be seekable or not. In some cases like parsing the whole presentation, we must have the whole stream to build the DOM. So in this case the source might not be seekable (e.g. in case of NetworkStream), and it's needed to load the whole stream in temporary storage to parse the presentation. Usage of the temporary files must be enabled in this mode (IBlobManagementOptions.IsTemporaryFilesAllowed is set to true), an exception will be thrown otherwise.\nCustomizations of BLOBs management behavior\n\nA number of options can be customized to provide the behavior most suitable for a specific environment and achieve the optimal ratio of performance and memory consumption in any particular case.\n\nIn a number of cases BLOB management uses a temporary files to handle situations when the source stream can't be locked by Presentation object. You may disable the usage of temporary files using IBlobManagementOptions.IsTemporaryFilesAllowed property. In this case any stream that can't be locked will be downloaded in memory.\n\nBeside that, the root path of the temporary files can be changed. By default, the system's default temporary files folder is used.\n\nThe other option that can be customized is the amount of process's memory that can be safely used to store the BLOBs before it will be dumped to a temporary files. It's faster to avoid the file system operations if there is no memory pressure, and the IBlobManagementOptions.MaxBlobsBytesInMemory property can be used to set the value the most appropriate for every particular case. The default value is 600Mb.\nWorking with BLOBs\n\nOpen and save the large presentation\n\nHere's is the sample of opening and saving the very large presentation:\n\nstatic void OpenAndSaveLargePresentation()\n{\n    // supposed the size of presentation is very large, let's say more than 2Gb\n    const string pathToVeryLargePresentationFile = \"veryLargePresentation.pptx\";\n\n    LoadOptions loadOptions = new LoadOptions\n    {\n        BlobManagementOptions = {\n            // let's choose the KeepLocked behavior - the \"veryLargePresentation.pptx\" will be locked for\n            // the Presentation's instance lifetime, but we don't need to load it into memory or copy into\n            // thetemporary file\n            PresentationLockingBehavior = PresentationLockingBehavior.KeepLocked,\n        }\n    };\n\n    using (Presentation pres = new Presentation(pathToVeryLargePresentationFile, loadOptions))\n    {\n        // the huge presentation is loaded and ready to use, but the memory consumption is still low.\n\n        // make any changes to the presentation.\n        pres.Slides[0].Name = \"Very large presentation\";\n\n        // presentation will be saved to the other file, the memory consumptions still low during saving.\n        pres.Save(\"veryLargePresentation-copy.pptx\", SaveFormat.Pptx);\n\n        // can't do that! IO exception will be thrown, because the file is locked while pres objects will\n        // not be disposed\n        File.Delete(pathToVeryLargePresentationFile);\n    }\n\n    // it's ok to do it here, the source file is not locked by pres object\n    File.Delete(pathToVeryLargePresentationFile);\n}\n\nAdding new BLOB to the presentation\n\nThis example demonstrates how to include the large BLOB (video file in that case) and prevent a high memory consumption.\n\nstatic void AddingNewBlobToPresentation()\n{\n    // supposed we have the very large video file we want to include into the presentation\n    const string pathToVeryLargeVideo = \"veryLargeVideo.avi\";\n\n    // create a new presentation which will contain this video\n    using (Presentation pres = new Presentation())\n    {\n        using (FileStream fileStream = new FileStream(pathToVeryLargeVideo, FileMode.Open))\n        {\n            // let's add the video to the presentation - we choose KeepLocked behavior, because we not\n            // have an intent to access the \"veryLargeVideo.avi\" file.\n            IVideo video = pres.Videos.AddVideo(fileStream, LoadingStreamBehavior.KeepLocked);\n            pres.Slides[0].Shapes.AddVideoFrame(0, 0, 480, 270, video);\n\n            // save the presentation. Despite that the output presentation will be very large, the memory\n            // consumption will be low the whole lifetime of the pres object\n            pres.Save(\"presentationWithLargeVideo.pptx\", SaveFormat.Pptx);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nExporting BLOB from presentation into stream\n\nConsider that we have a very large presentation containing multiple large BLOBs - audio and video files. We want to extract these files from presentation and don't want to load this presentation into memory to keep our memory consumption low. Here's is an example how we can achieve that:\n\n static void ExportBlobsFromPresentaion()\n{\n    // supposed the presentation contains a multiple audios and videos and it size is huge.\n    const string hugePresentationWithAudiosAndVideosFile = @\"c:\\bin\\aspose\\Tasks\\020, 38595\\orig\\Large  Video File Test1.pptx\";\n\n    LoadOptions loadOptions = new LoadOptions\n    {\n        BlobManagementOptions =\n        {\n            // lock the source file and don't load it into memory\n            PresentationLockingBehavior = PresentationLockingBehavior.KeepLocked,\n        }\n    };\n\n    // create the Presentation's instance, lock the \"hugePresentationWithAudiosAndVideos.pptx\" file.\n    using (Presentation pres = new Presentation(hugePresentationWithAudiosAndVideosFile, loadOptions))\n    {\n        // let's save each video to a file. to prevent memory usage we need a buffer which will be used\n        // to exchange tha data from the presentation's video stream to a stream for newly created video file.\n        byte[] buffer = new byte[8 * 1024];\n\n        // iterate through the videos\n        for (var index = 0; index < pres.Videos.Count; index++)\n        {\n            IVideo video = pres.Videos[index];\n\n            // open the presentation video stream. Please note that we intentionally avoid accessing properties\n            // like video.BinaryData - this property returns a byte array containing full video, and that means\n            // this bytes will be loaded into memory. We will use video.GetStream, which will return Stream and\n            // that allows us to not load the whole video into memory.\n            using (Stream presVideoStream = video.GetStream())\n            {\n                using (FileStream outputFileStream = File.OpenWrite($\"video{index}.avi\"))\n                {\n                    int bytesRead;\n                    while ((bytesRead = presVideoStream.Read(buffer, 0, buffer.Length)) > 0)\n                    {\n                        outputFileStream.Write(buffer, 0, bytesRead);\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n\n            // memory consumption will stay low no matter what size the videos or presentation is.\n        }\n\n        // do the same for audios if needed.\n    }\n}\n\nAPI\n\nA number of the new properties, classes and enums has been added to support BLOBs handling.\nILoadOptions\n\nBlobManagementOptions property of type IBlobManagementOptions has been added. It represents the options which can be used to manage Binary Large Objects (BLOBs) handling behavior, such as using of temporary files or max BLOBs bytes in memory.\nIBlobManagementOptions interface\n\nA new interface IBlobManagementOptions has been added. It inteded to configure a a different behavior aspects regarding BLOBs handling for the IPresentation instance lifetime.\n\nPresentationLockingBehavior property of PresentationLockingBehavior enum. This property defines if an instance of the Presentation class can be an owner of the source - file or stream during the instance lifetime. If the instance is an owner, it locks the source.\nIsTemporaryFilesAllowed of type bool. This property defines if temporary files can be created while working with BLOBs, what greatly decreases the memory consumption but requires permissions to create files.\nTempFilesRootPath of type string. The root path where temporary files will be created. Hosting process should have permissions to create files and folders there.\nMaxBlobsBytesInMemory of type ulong. Defines the maximum amount (in bytes) that all BLOBs in total may occupy in memory.\n\nPresentationLockingBehavior enum\n\nThe new PresentationLockingBehavior enum has been added, it values represents the behavior regarding treating the IPresentation source (file or Stream) while loading and working with an instance of IPresentation. It has the following members:\n\nLoadAndRelease - The source will be locked only for a time of IPresentation constructor execution.\nKeepLocked - The source will be locked for a whole lifetime of IPresentation instance, until it will be disposed.\n\nIVideoCollection and IAudioCollection\n\nA new method has been added to IVideoCollection and IAudioCollection to support adding large videos and audios as streams to treat them as BLOBs:\n\nIVideo AddVideo(Stream stream, LoadingStreamBehavior loadingStreamBehavior)\nIAudio AddAudio(Stream stream, LoadingStreamBehavior loadingStreamBehavior)\nLoadingStreamBehavior\n\nThis new enum is used to select proper behavior to handle the stream. It contains the following possible values:\n\nReadStreamAndRelease - the stream will be read to the end and then released - i.e. it will be guaranteed that this stream will not be used by IPresentation instance in the future.\nKeepLocked - the stream will be locked inside the IPresentation object, i.e. the ownership of the stream will be transferred. The IPresentation object will be responsible to correctly dispose the stream when this object will be disposed itself.\n\nIVideo and IAudio\n\nTo support getting large BLOBs inside presentation as Stream a new method has been added:\n\nStream GetStream()\n\nIt returns Stream stream for reading. Please note that you must use 'using' or close stream after using.\nNew IExternalResourceResolver interface and ExternalResourceResolver class were added\n\nNew IExternalResourceResolver interface was added as a replacement of existing IHtmlExternalResolver (become obsolete).\nThis is a callback interface used to resolve external resources during Html, Svg documents import.\n\n/// <summary>\n/// Callback interface used to resolve external resources during Html, Svg documents import.\n/// </summary>\n[ComVisible(true), Guid(\"88ff6edd-d6d4-43e4-b25a-7806671fe7ca\")]\npublic interface IExternalResourceResolver\n{\n    /// <summary>\n    /// Resolves the absolute URI from the base and relative URIs.\n    /// </summary>\n    /// <param name=\"baseUri\">Base URI of linking objects</param>\n    /// <param name=\"relativeUri\">Relative URI to the linked object.</param>\n    /// <returns>Absolute URI or null if the relative URI cannot be resolved.</returns>\n    string ResolveUri(string baseUri, string relativeUri);\n\n    /// <summary>\n    /// Maps a URI to an object containing the actual resource.\n    /// </summary>\n    /// <param name=\"absoluteUri\">Absolute URI to the object.</param>\n    /// <returns> A <see cref=\"System.IO.Stream\"/> object or null if resource cannot be streamed.</returns>\n    System.IO.Stream GetEntity(string absoluteUri);\n}\n\nExternalResourceResolver is default implementation of IExternalResourceResolver.\n\nPlease note: Using ExternalResourceResolver could create a vulnerability when client provided HTML or SVG file will make server software to obtain local or network file. Use with caution. It is recommended not to specify ExternalResourceResolver at all (only embedded objects will be read - see \"Sample 1\") or create some subclass which checks if specified uri is valid.\nNew property EmbeddedFileData has been added to IOleObjectFrame\n\nA new property EmbeddedFileData has been added to IOleObjectFrame. It's needed to retrieve the file data of embedded OLE object.\n\nFor example, when an image has been embedded into presentation, its data can be accessed through EmbeddedFileData property:\n\nusing (Presentation pres = new Presentation(pptxFileName))\n{\n  IOleObjectFrame oleObjectFrame = (IOleObjectFrame)pres.Slides[0].Shapes[0];\n  string fileName = oleObjectFrame.EmbeddedFileName;\n  byte[] data = oleObjectFrame.EmbeddedFileData;\n}\n\nOfficeInteropShapeId property was added to IShape interface and Shape class respectively\n\nProperty OfficeInteropShapeId was added to IShape interfaces and Shape class respectively.\n\nThis property allows getting unique shape identifier in slide scope in contrast to the UniqueId property, which allows obtaining a unique identifier in presentation scope.\n\nThe value returned by OfficeInteropShapeId property corresponds to the value of the Id of the Microsoft.Office.Interop.PowerPoint.Shape object.\n\nCode example:\n\nusing (Presentation presentation = new Presentation(\"Presentation.pptx\"))\n{\n    // Getting unique shape identifier in slide scope\n    long officeInteropShapeId = presentation.Slides[0].Shapes[0].OfficeInteropShapeId;\n}\n\nTextFrame property has been added to ISmartArtShape interface and SmartArtShape class\n\nTextFrame property has been added to ISmartArtShape interface and SmartArtShape class respectively.\n\nThis property allows you to get all text from SmartArt if it has not only nodes text.\n\nusing (Presentation pres = new Presentation(\"Presentation.pptx\"))\n{\n            ISlide slide = presentation.Slides[0];\n            ISmartArt smartArt = (ISmartArt)slide.Shapes[0];\n\n            ISmartArtNodeCollection smartArtNodes = smartArt.AllNodes;\n            foreach (ISmartArtNode smartArtNode in smartArtNodes)\n            {\n                foreach (ISmartArtShape nodeShape in smartArtNode.Shapes)\n                {\n                    if (nodeShape.TextFrame != null)\n                        Console.WriteLine(nodeShape.TextFrame.Text);\n                }\n            }\n}",
