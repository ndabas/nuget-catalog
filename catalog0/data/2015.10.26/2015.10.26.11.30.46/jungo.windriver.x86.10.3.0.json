  "releaseNotes": "Version 10.3.0 (Release Date: January 30, 2011) \nNew Features\n## Windows: Added a version of the WinDriver .NET API DLL (wdapi_dotnet1030.dll) for .NET Framework 4.0. \n## Linux: Added support for Linux kernel 2.6.37. \nEnhancements\n## USB on Windows CE: Improved streaming performance. \n## PCI on Linux and Mac OS X: Implemented the WDC_GET_ENABLED_INT_LAST_MSG macro, for retrieving the message data of the last received MSI/MSI?-X interrupt. \n## USB on Windows: Added a .NET wrapper for WDU_SelectiveSuspend(). \n## Kernel PlugIn (PCI on Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X): Added support for communicating with a 64-?bit Kernel PlugIn from a 32-?bit application. The changes include a new KP_INIT struct field (funcOpen_32_64), and improvements to the PCI Kernel PlugIn sample (kp_pci) and the DriverWizard Kernel PlugIn code generation. \nFixes\n## Windows: wdreg � fixed enabling/disabling of multiple devices in an INF file when encountering an error with one of the devices. \n## PCI on Linux x86_64: Fixed a crash during PCI read/write operations � for example, in calls to WD_Transfer(), or during the execution of interrupt transfer commands. \n## USB on 64-?bit Windows: Fixed an OS crash when calling WDU_StreamGetStatus() from a 32-?bit application. \n## Linux 2.4.x: Fixed the WinDriver build process (issue since v10.2.1). \n## USB on Windows: Fixed the behavior of isochronous write (OUT) streams with the USB_ISOCH_NOASAP flag set. \n## Windows: Fixed the support for the Windows 7 WDK build options � win7 and win7_x64 � in the ddk_make.bat build script. This also resolved related Kernel PlugIn build issues. (Issue since v10.2.1)\n## PCI on Windows: WDC_PciDeviceOpen() � fixed identification of PCI devices that were not registered with WinDriver (issue since v10.2.1). \n## Debug Monitor: Changed the default debug level of the command-line Debug Monitor utility � wddebug � to D_TRACE, to match the GUI Debug Monitor utility (wddebug_gui). \n## PCI on Mac OS X: Fixed an OS crash when reusing a DMA buffer for more than one transfer (issue since v10.2.0). \n## PCI on Linux 2.6.x: Fixed a possible kernel panic when allocating a contiguous DMA buffer. \n## PCI on Mac OS X: Fixed an OS crash when unregistering a Plug?-?and?-?Play / power-?management PCI event (issue since v10.2.0). \n## USB on 64-?bit Linux: Fixed infinite-timeout handling in WDU_Transfer(). \n## PCI on Mac OS X: Fixed occasional calls to the user interrupt handler when no hardware interrupt had occurred. \n## PCI on Mac OS X: Fixed the value of the virtual kernel-mode mapped address returned by WDC_DMAContigBufLock(), WDC_SharedBufferAlloc(), and WD_DMALock(), for a contiguous DMA or shared buffer allocation.\n The fix resolved an OS crash when using the returned address in a data transfer. \n## PCI on Mac OS X: Fixed the detection of device memory regions. \n## PCI on Mac OS X and Windows CE: Added interrupt resource cleanup for devices that have not been explicitly closed by the application, as part of WinDriver's application cleanup. \n## PCI: Fixed an application crash upon passing an invalid device handle to WDC_ReadXXX() or WDC_WriteXXX(). \n## Windows Mobile ARMV4I: Fixed incorrect path to the WinDriver-API library in the sample and generated WinDriver Platform Builder projects, which caused the project build to fail (issue since v7.0.1). \n## PCI on 64-?bit OSs: Fixed a memory leak caused by neglecting to unmap user-mode memory space from kernel mode when running 32-?bit applications. \n## ISA/PCMCIA on Windows Vista and higher: Fixed an OS crash when calling WDC_IntDisable() for ISA/PCMCIA devices (issue since v9.2.0). \n## PCI on Mac OS X: Fixed handling of 64-?bit DMA addresses.",
