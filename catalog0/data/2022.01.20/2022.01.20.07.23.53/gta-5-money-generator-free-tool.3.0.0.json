As fans, the logical thing to do would be to get excited for a new game in the series, right? Wrong, actually. Rockstar says you’re going to get another re-release of a 2013 game, and you’re going to like it.\n\nFirst announced back in 2020, reception for the PS5 remaster of GTA V has been very mixed. The first gameplay trailer left fans struggling to actually notice any difference between the new version and the 2015 PS4 and Xbox One ports, which y’know, hardly bodes well. But despite the port not seeming to offer anything new, that didn’t stop Rockstar from delaying it to March this year, soaring past the original release date of 11 November 2021. Now, it looks like it might be delayed even more.",
