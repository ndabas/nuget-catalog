The reason behind this is the ‘PLAY MERGE DRAGONS ONLINE FREE’ scams that proliferate the internet.

If you do this you have just given the scammers all of the information they need to take over the account and clear it out. No matter how tempting these sites are you need to know that there is NO SUCH THING AS PLAY MERGE DRAGONS ONLINE FREE. Only purchase Generator using the methods mentioned before.\nBefore creating any custom design to sell the player will need to make sure they have already created an item of clothing. It's possible to upload a skin of the clothing directly to PLAY MERGE DRAGONS ONLINE FREE thereby showing the design on your character and making it available for use.\nIf you sign up for a premium membership then you are automatically given a stipend of so many Generator each month. If you pay $4.99 per month then you will receive 450 Generator while those paying $9.99 a month will be given 1000 Generator per month.\nIn the box that says ‘Enter Your Code’ players should input the code they are trying to redeem. If entering the code is followed by a green thumbs-up the redemption was successful and the items should be in the player's inventory. If entering the code is followed by a red thumbs-down icon the code is invalid meaning it is likely expired or has already been redeemed.\nFree Coins,Free Gems,Free Diamonds,Free Spins, free coins generator no human verification\n",
