  "releaseNotes": "This build from https://github.com/SteveGilham/altcover/tree/3ba64d623004c4e541453fd4ffbabd64425944b7\n\nQ. Never mind the fluff -- how do I get started?\nA. Start with the Quick Start guide : https://github.com/SteveGilham/altcover/wiki/QuickStart-Guide and\nread the FAQ : https://github.com/SteveGilham/altcover/wiki/FAQ\n\n8.6.125 (Habu series release 25)\n• [BUGFIX] Issue 197 : Update [InternalsVisibleTo] references during instrumentation.  Finally fixing an issue that's been there since 2010!\n\n8.6.95 (Habu series release 24)\n• Built with and supports net8.0 release\n• Other dependency updates.\n• Minor housekeeping changes, but no actual new features.\n\n8.6.68 (Habu series release 23)\n• Omit anonymous types from coverage, in the same way as other compiler generated code (auto-properties, equality and related operations on F# distributed unions, etc.)\n• Supports net8.0 preview 5\n\n8.6.61 (Habu series release 22)\n• [BUGFIX] prevent possible \"The lists had different lengths.\" exception in the collect phase (Issue 181)\n• Removes some obsolete code from the dotnet test integration\n• Drop support for Fake 5.23.x\n• Supports net8.0 preview 4\n• Updated to Cecil 11.5, removing the need for workrounds for issues noted at 11.4\n• Other dependency updates.\n\n8.6.48 (Habu series release 21a)\n• [BUGFIX] Correctly package the visualizer for net5.0, as well as building it against the later platform\n\n8.6.45 (Habu series release 21)\n• [BUGFIX] Issue #179 - Improve and strengthen the heuristic for locating dependent assemblies, prossibly slightly speeding the look-up in the process by eliminating potentially duplicated effort.\n\n8.6.40 (Habu series release 20)\n• [BUGFIX] Issue #178 - possible NRE when instrumenting woven code e.g. using Fody\n• [AvaloniaVisualizer] Now requires net5.0 or later\n• Supports Fake 6.0.0.  This is probably the last release that will support earlier versions, as 5.23.1 is almost 6 months old.\n• Supports net8.0 previews 1,2 (so far, no nasty surprises like with the 7.0.100 release)\n\n8.6.14 (Habu series release 19)\n• [GTKVisualizer] Fix an off-by-one crash for coverlet generated files\n• [AvaloniaVisualizer] Fix possible crash launching the About dialog\n• [Visualizer] Display coverage percentages against nodes of the tree (known issue that the synthetic F# module nodes are not thus decorated)\n• [Visualizer] Improve handling of larger coverage files by deferring more processing until the tree model is actually expanded.\n• [API] Types Options.CLI, Options.Logging, Options.Prepare and Options.Collect in namespace AltCover; concrete implementations of the ICLIOptions, ILoggingOptions and IPrepareOptions and ICollectOptions respectively, with getter and setter for each property.  Default values for the latter two are as per the corresponding Primitive record types.\n• [API] Also on the AltCover.Fake package in the AltCoverFake.DotNet.Testing namespace (except Options.Logging which is not useful in that context)\n\n8.5.842 (Habu series release 18)\n• [VISUALIZER] As the relevant Avalonia issue is long resolved, move to having separate dialog boxes for the Avalonia Visualizer's \"About\" and message box, as in the GTK# version.\n• ref struct types have an autogenerated [Obsolete] attribute with a standard comment - detect and ignore such attributes.  See https://turnerj.com/blog/ref-structs-are-technically-obsolete for details.\n\n8.5.841 (Habu series release 17)\n• To support Cake 3.0, move the Cake API assembly from AltCover.Api to a new package AltCover.Cake; this contains libraries built against Cake 2.0.0 at netcoreapp3.1 as well as the old ones built against Cake 1.0.0 at netstandard2.0 (present but in practice obsolete).\n• Following Fake.build's policy of deprecating releases older then 6 month, drop support for versions before 5.23\n• [BREAKING] Rename AltCover.Cake.DotNet.DotNetCoreTest to AltCover.Cake.DotNet.DotNetTest (even in the obsolete 1.0.0 build) to match the changes in the Cake APIs (and consequent chage to the test setting type in the argument list).  Similarly, in the version >= 2.0.0 build, the type AltCover.Cake.DotNet is now a [CakeAliasCategory(\"DotNet\")] rather than [CakeAliasCategory(\"DotNetCore\")]\n• [API] New DotNet APIs for Fake support - ToTestPropertiesList method to emit a list of (name,value) pairs to allow customised property passing to dotnet test in the wake of the v7.0.100 regression.\n• [API] Additionally ImportModuleProperties and GetVersionProperties values that are additonal lists of (name,value) pairs to append as needed.\n\nFor previous releases (8.4.840 and earlier) go here -- https://github.com/SteveGilham/altcover/blob/master/ReleaseNotes%20-%20Previously.md",
