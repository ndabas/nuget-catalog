  "description": "Author's note: Although many frameworks already exist for working with settings, most are complicated or over engineered for simple usage scenarios. I reluctantly created NSettings because I needed a library that satisfied these specific needs: the public API is simple and obvious; the dependencies and runtime footprint are as small as possible; settings are key/value pairs and the keys may optionally be saved in named groups; the backing storage is customisable. The basic library has implementations that use the Registry or an XML file as backing storage. The solution also contains experimental but fully working implementations that use Azure Tables and SQL Server as the backing storage.",
