In the same way that an Xbox is a gaming platform so is 4 Pics 1 Word. 4 Pics 1 Word as a company provides developers with the tools and marketplace to show off their games to players in a similar way to other games consoles. Within 4 Pics 1 Word there are literally millions of different games available for people to play.\nWhen Generator are spent in a game the developers will get a cut and this is how they make money. Almost every game will have something you can buy with Generator and they do a great job of highlighting these within games making it very easy to spend spend spend.
