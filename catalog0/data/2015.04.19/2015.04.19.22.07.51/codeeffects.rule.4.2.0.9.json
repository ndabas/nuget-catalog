  "description": "Code Effects is one of the fastest business rules engines that allows creation, modification, validation and evaluation of complex business rules, as well as creation and execution of complex rule-based data filters for virtually all established LINQ providers. Using its web interface, business users can create rules or filters by selecting options from a series of context-sensitive drop-down menus. This IntelliSense-like approach is unique to web-based business rule management. With Code Effects integrated into your project, the most complex business rules can be authored without any knowledge of programming languages. Detailed documentation can be found at CodeEffects.com/Doc",

  "releaseNotes": "In-rule methods can now be used in calculations.\n\nNew IncludeInCalculations property has been added to the MethodAttribute. By default, it's set to True for all in-rule methods that return numeric values. It's ignored by other in-rule methods.\n\nNew version of Source XML schema has been introduced. This schema is used only with the newest version, all existing Source XML documents that reference previous schemas will continue to work as expected.\n\nClicking on brackets that define calculation elements and logical parentheses now shows relevant context menus. This helps to edit a rule using only a mouse.\n\nImproved implicit type conversion of parameters for in-rule methods and actions. This allows better compatibility of existing rules with the updated source object(s) if a method or an action's signature changes.\n\nDue to a large number of requests, this version now uses parentheses to separate calculations from the rest of the rule in rule string representation when any of the overloads of the RuleEditor.ToString() method are used.\n\nAdded filtering support to the setters context menu which was absent in previous versions.",
