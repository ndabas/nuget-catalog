These Brawlers are the gameâ€™s characters. There are currently 15 Brawlers available. You start with one and as you play you unlock new brawlers. These brawlers also have various types. Some are fighters or healers while others are assassins or sharp shooters. Each brawler as an Attack, Super and Star Power. One of our favourite n00b brawlers is Nita. The evil little kid in the bear hat. She is able to rupture or play overbearing depending on what you need but her Star Power is Bear With Me\n\nwhere she releases her own bear into the arena to fight on her behalf.The more you play, the more brawlers you unlock.
