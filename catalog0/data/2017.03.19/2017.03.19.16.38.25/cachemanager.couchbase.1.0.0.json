  "releaseNotes": "This is finally the 1.0 release. It has been some time but after migration the solution to the new csproj format and Visual Studio 2017, it was about time ;) Thanks everyone for supporting this library and sending in either feature requests, questions or bug reports! **New Things** * New serializer(s) based on [Microsoft.Bond](https://github.com/Microsoft/bond) supporting all three Bond serializers! #127 * Eviction based events reacting on the cache vendor specific evictions see #116 * New event on `BaseCacheManager` with information about which cache handle and why the event was triggered * With this, CacheManager now can sync the cache `Up`. **Minor New Things** * Dictionary Cache Handle now has a timer based eviction loop which should be more reliable. * The Memcached cache handle now finally has a working clear region function #104 * All serializers can be used via Microsoft's configuration extensions as known types (also added to the json schema) * Memcached and Redis cache handles now can be configured to use an already initialized client. The `WithxyzHandle` extension methods have new overloads to pass in the existing client. #118 **Bug Fixes** * #134 Serialization had some issues in some cases with loading the correct Types * #136 when working with absolute expiration, there were some odds when renewing the expiration date * Memcached handle had a bug in version 0.9.3 when configured via xml configuration section, see #118 **Breaking Changes** * UpdateMode `Full` has been removed * Minimum netstandard has been increased to 1.2 from 1.1 for the `Core` package Please report any bugs on github, and feel free to ask questions on either StackOverflow with the `[cachemanager]` tag or on our (moved) homepage http://cachemanager.michaco.net.",
