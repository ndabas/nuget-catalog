  "description": "Aspose.CAD for .NET is a class library that enables your applications to perform a great range of drawings processing tasks. Aspose.CAD supports DXF, DWG, DGN, DWF, DWFX, IFC, STL, DWT, IGES, PLT, CFF2, OBJ and other CAD formats. You can convert them to: PDF, BMP, GIF, JPG, JPEG, JPEG2000, PNG, WMF, TIFF, PSD, SVG formats. With Aspose.CAD you can generate, modify, convert, render drawings without utilizing Autodesk AutoCADÂ®.\n\nAspose.CAD for .NET is well documented to help you create your solutions on different platforms.\n\nRich Set of Features\n\nAspose.CAD for .NET features can be divided into three main areas:\n - Export and Conversions: High quality conversions to PDF, BMP, GIF, JPG, JPEG, JPEG2000, PNG, WMF, TIFF, PSD, SVG formats\n - Document Object Model manipulations: Programmatic access through a rich API to all drawing elements allows to modify, extract, copy, split, join, and replace drawing content\n - CAD Format switchings: load any supported file format and save it as DXF, DWG or DWF\n\nPlatform Independence\n\nYou can use Aspose.CAD for .NET to build any type of a 32-bit or 64-bit .NET application including .NET Framework with ASP.NET, WCF, WinForms or .NET Core stack.\n\nPerformance and Scalability\n\nAspose.CAD is designed to perform great both on a server or client. Aspose.CAD is a single .NET assembly that can be deployed with any .NET application by simply copying it. You do not have to worry about any other services or modules. You can literally generate thousands of images in minutes with Aspose.CAD and that involves opening a drawing, modifying content or populating it with data and saving it. Even most of the complex drawings are opened and saved on a P4 2.4Ghz 1Gb RAM machine in a second.\n\nAspose.CAD is multi-thread safe as long as only one thread works on a drawing at a time. It is a typical scenario to have one thread working on one drawing. Different threads can safely work on different drawings at the same time.\n\nNotice\n\n*In case you work with DWG/DXF files that contain PDF underlays, you have to additionally install Aspose.PDF so that underlays could be rendered.\n\n\nFree support for Aspose.CAD for .NET is provided on our support forum:\nhttps://forum.aspose.com/ \nand on StackOverflow:\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/aspose.cad",
