If you are playing the game, then you must have heard about Minecoins. The Wiki page would tell you that there are no ways to get free Minecoins but that‚Äôs not entirely true. In this article, we are going to help you get Minecoins for free.\n\nWe are going to take a look at what Minecoins are and how you can get them. We are also going to show you how you can redeem Minecoin codes and talk about the fake Minecraft Minecoin generators that are found everywhere online. Let‚Äôs get started.\n\nWhat Are Minecoins? Minecoins are the official currency used in Minecraft. It‚Äôs a golden coin with an ‚ÄúM‚Äù logo on it. Whenever you et Minecoins, it is assigned to your Xbox Live account. Minecoins are the same as Minecraft tokens(for PS4 players). However, this is only available for the Bedrock edition of the game.\n\nMinecraft is a massive game and it‚Äôs perfect for creative people. You can create your own interesting worlds with it. Some people create custom skins and texture mods for the game. The Minecraft marketplace lets the player share these creations with others for a certain amount of Minecoins.\n\nOfficially, there are no ways to get free Minecoins and you have to purchase them with real money. However, if you are looking for free Minecoins, then do not worry, we have your back. Just to be clear, we are not going to cover any Minecoin generators, they are scams and we will cover them later on in this article.\n\nHow to Get Free Minecoins Currently, there are only two methods I would recommend for free Minecoins. You can try both of them to get the maximum amount of currency.Microsoft has a reward program called Microsoft rewards. You can use this program to get an Xbox gift card which can in turn be redeemed for free Minecoins.",
