But why would you” he says matter-of-factly. “In pandemic times it's easy to say that: ‘You can go online and watch movies with your mates!’ But why would I need to go online when I can just watch it on my television which is much bigger – and doesn't have little [avatars] anywhere”\nIt’s a sad but true fact that where there is money to make you will always find the worst kind of people and KSniper Challenge is no exception.
