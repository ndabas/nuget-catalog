  "description": "(Latest updated) Monopoly Go Free dice links today from twitter, facebook and Instagram. Get 150 free dices daily using these Monopoly Go dice links.\n\nðŸ‘‰ https://yodamegame.com/monopolygo/\n\nWe have collected more than five dice links for you in social media to claim over 100 dices free every day. Every eight hours or so, you can throw a ton of pen at this huge Monopoly Go as a reward for earning dices. This will earn you hundreds of dices at once, so be sure to claim the bonus immediately after unlocking. The earlier you receive the bonus, the earlier the countdown to the next bonus begins. For every loss of about one sixth, a video discount will pop up, offering you 15 free coins to watch the advertisement. Therefore, if you want to earn coins as soon as possible, as long as you start a level, you immediately lose. In this way, video advertisements appear faster and more frequently. Your score is independent of the frequency of video popups.",
