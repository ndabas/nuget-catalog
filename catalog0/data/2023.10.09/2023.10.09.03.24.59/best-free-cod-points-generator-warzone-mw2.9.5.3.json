Try this best cod point generator for all version. CP is limited, and when it runs out, you usually have to wait for it to recover or purchase more with cash. Otherwise, if you have friends playing games or interested friends, log in to Facebook and send them energy requests. Make sure to send CP to them when they request it. If you don't have friends to play, but you still want to use Facebook's options, please only use the second account in the game. Log in to the game with your second account, then add people to the App Store, Google Play, or NCIS Hidden Crimes Facebook group and send energy back and forth with them. This way, as long as someone can trade CP, you can play the game as you want. Also try new cod point codes - UTKQ94718QIQ - to get 200K cp in a few seconds.",
