  "releaseNotes": "Breaking changes in v4.0.0\n\n- The property `Log.CustomConfig` is renamed to `Log.GlobalConfig`, and an access attempt to `Log.GlobalConfig` before invoking `Log.Initialize` will raise `InvalidOperationException`.\n- Now if the user indicates to use the program path (provided `false` for `LoggerConfig.Use_Working_Directory`) during `Log.Initialize` and it cannot be accessed, compared with the previous implementation, it will not issue a warning that the program will fallback to the working directory. Similarly, there will be no warning prompts if an error occurs when compressing past log files.\n- **IMPORTANT**: In the new version, the default color Logger using in Console is changed to `ConsoleColor.Gray` to be consistent to most Console implements. You can also change this setting by `Log.GlobalDefaultColor` property now.\n- **IMPORTANT**: In the new version, when `Log.Initialize` processing past logs, not only `latest.log` and `latest.debug.log`, but **any log files under the `logs` folder that match the pattern `latest.*.log`** will be renamed to the last time they were written.  \n  They are also affected by automatic log compression, but this is actually consistent with past behavior.\n- Now if invoking `Log.Initialize` or `BaseLogger.Initialize` on platforms not supporting the Console with `LoggerConfig.Console_Minimum_LogLevel` not set to `LogLevel.None`, an exception will be immerdiately thrown.  \n  You can also use this logger on these platforms, but outputing logs to the Console should be disabled. Windows, macOS, Linux are treated as supported platforms currently.\n- Now at the end of the program, the leave time given to Logger is 1000ms, and the leave time given to console output (whether it is normal output or `ConsoleWrapper`) is 500ms (it will only be performed after Logger's cleaning work is completed). In previous versions, these two numbers were 300ms and 1200ms respectively.\n- The color judgment uses a new algorithm, so it may not be \"bug compatible\" with the previous implementation.\n- `ConsoleWrapper` uses a new algorithm, developers try to put the breaking changes caused by it below, but the fixed bugs may not be listed.\n- `ConsoleWrapper` used to support pasting multi-line text into the input with newline characters reserved (although there will be problems when modifying the text); now it does not support this function, and all newline characters pasted will be replaced with two spaces.\n  > The list of recognized newline sequences is CR (U+000D), LF (U+000A), CRLF (U+000D U+000A), NEL (U+0085), LS (U+2028), FF (U+000C), and PS (U+2029). This list is given by the Unicode Standard, Sec. 5.8, Recommendation R4 and Table 5-2.\n\n  However, if your program utilizes the \"converting newline characters to spaces for a single input\" feature, you may prompt the user to use `Ctrl`+`Alt`+`V` in Windows Terminal.\n\n- `ConsoleWrapper` now supports history merging similar to bash, that is, executing a command multiple times in a row will not leave multiple records in history.\n- `ConsoleWrapper` will no longer include unconfirmed input in the command history. Therefore, pressing the up/down arrow keys will not include unconfirmed input. For example, if you enter `1[Enter]2[Enter][Up Arrow][Enter]` **without any thread waiting for `ConsoleWrapper.ReadLine`**, the third call to `ConsoleWrapper.ReadLine` will return an empty string (in previous versions, it would return `2`).\n- The new reading method of `ConsoleWrapper` is similar to [GNU Readline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Readline), but this causes a conflict with the past behavior of Ctrl+C, so the function of Ctrl+C triggering the `ConsoleWrapper.ShutDownRequest` event is retained. In addition to this, all other functions of the attached GNU readline shortcut keys can be regarded as breaking changes.\n- In order to support the input of Chinese and full-width characters and other wide characters, while avoiding the processing of various corner cases, now `ConsoleWrapper` reduces the number of characters that can fit in a single line by 1 bit, which is reserved as the extra space for full-width characters.\n- Now, if a command input line have characters exceeding the console window, it won't be recorded in the input history. You can set `ConsoleWrapper.HistoryMaximumChars` to change the default behaviour.  \n  Set it to a positive value can apply the limit, 0 can stop the history (since then), and -1 can cancel the limit. \n- This project will not be backward compatible with any version below `.NET 6.0` in the future, including `.NET Standard 2.1`.\n\nChanges in v4.0.1\n\n- Fixed the issue whereby the file created in the constructor of `BaseLogger` using the overload `BaseLogger(LoggerConfig, LogFileConfig)` could not be utilized in the overload `BaseLogger(LoggerConfig, string)`.\n- Fixed the issue whereby after using the overload `BaseLogger(LoggerConfig, LogFileConfig)` in the constructor of `BaseLogger`, multiple files with the same name or only case-insensitive differences were allowed to be created without checks.\n\nThese fixes also apply to other similar overloads.\n\nChanges in v4.0.0\n\nThis version almost re-implements the entire logger, extracting the main functions of the static class `Log` and encapsulating them into `BaseLogger`. The original functions are not affected and some bugs have been fixed, but there may be some breaking changes.\n\nPlease note that although `BaseLogger` is a complete log implementation, you must first call `Log.Initialize` to use it. In addition, although different initialization `LoggerConfig` can be provided for each `BaseLogger`, its key fields must be consistent with the version provided when `Log.Initialize`, to keep the behavior of Logger consistent throughout the program.  \nThe affected fields at this stage are: `Use_Console_Wrapper`, `Use_Working_Directory`, `Max_Output_Char_Count`, `Enable_Detailed_Time`.\n\nMain changes:\n\n- Fixed the problem that due to the defect of the timing algorithm, the log processing background task will not wait for the specified time after processing the log.\n- Fixed the problem that in most cases, the waiting time for cleaning (1.5s) will reach the maximum value, and it is still possible that the console cleaning cannot be completed.\n- Fixed the problem that when not reading input by `ConsoleWrapper`, event `ConsoleWrapper.ShutDownRequest` cannot be triggered by pressing Ctrl+C, until someone starting reading input again.\n- Fixed the problem that in certain conditions, `ConsoleWrapper` accepts invalid characters.\n- Fixed the problem that when providing some log methods and members including `Log.PushLog` with invalid `LogLevel`, the logs will enter the handle queue and possibly make the handle thread crash.\n- A new KMP-based algorithm is used to analyze color tag information, which speeds up processing. See [Benchmark data](https://github.com/YYHEggEgg/csharp-logger/blob/main/ColorLineUtil-report-github.md) for details.\n- Added `LogTextWriter` that implements the abstract class `TextWriter`. But note that it uses a buffer to maintain characters that have not been wrapped; that is, all content before the newline character is not displayed in `Logger`.  \n  If some external code uses `Console`'s methods and you use `ConsoleWrapper` (such as `CommandLineParser`), you must provide an instance of `LogTextWriter` for it.\n- To make `sender` param not required for each time of logging, `LoggerChannel` is added. For code that implements a certain logic, it usually passes the same `sender` parameter when calling the `Log` method, in which condition you can create `LoggerChannel` with this `sender` to reduce the amount of code and increase maintainability.\n- Some static methods pointing to the corresponding methods of `BaseLogger` were created in the `Log` static class.\n- Now you can set whether to enable time details by setting `LoggerConfig.Enable_Detailed_Time`. By default, the time recorded by Logger is only accurate to the second and does not include the date, corresponding to the formatted string `HH:mm:ss`.  \n  After enabling time details, the details of the log submission time up to one-seventh of a second will be displayed. The corresponding formatted string is `yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss fff ffff`. The two parts `fff` and `ffff` represent the millisecond level and the ten-thousandth of a millisecond (100 nanoseconds, 0.1 microseconds) level, such as `2023-08-22 15:43:36 456 4362`. This configuration requires global unity and is effective for both console and log file output.\n- When creating a new log file, you can use `LogFileConfig.IsPipeSeparatedFormat` to indicate whether the created log file is a pipe-separated value file (PSV).  \n  Outputting the log as a table is helpful for analysis when the data volume is extremely large, especially if a large amount of modular code in the program does not change the sender parameter when calling the Log method. This configuration does not affect the content output to the console, and for some performance considerations, currently only `|` is accepted as the separator. The output format is:\n\n  ```log\n  [time]|[level]|[sender]|[content]\n  23:14:17|Warn|TestSender|Push a warning log!\n  ```\n\n- Now you can provide a `basedlogger` parameter for `LogTraceListener` and `LogTextWriter` to change their output target `BaseLogger`. The default value is still `Log.GlobalBasedLogger` shared by the global static class `Log`.\n- Some codes of [tonerdo/readline](https://github.com/tonerdo/readline) are used to implement the new version of `ConsoleWrapper`. But please note that this version of the nuget package does not include references to the nuget package [ReadLine](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ReadLine), nor does it include the `ReadLine` class. All operations are still encapsulated as `ConsoleWrapper`.\n- The experience of modifying text when the text volume is large in `ConsoleWrapper` has been greatly improved.\n- Now setting `ConsoleWrapper.AutoCompleteHandler` can auto-complete user input.\n- Optimized the method indication in the `Log`, `BaseLogger` and `LoggerChannel` classes.\n- Now you can indicate that the content of the current line should not be included in the command input history by using `ConsoleWrapper.ReadLine(false)`. This is useful when prompting the user to input information that is specific to a certain context (e.g., a confirmation prompt like `Type 'y' to confirm, 'n' to refuse`).",
