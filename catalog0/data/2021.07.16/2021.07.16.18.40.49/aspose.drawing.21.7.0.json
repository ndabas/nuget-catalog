  "description": "Aspose.Drawing for .NET is a 2D graphics library with System.Drawing compatible API. It allows your cross-platform .NET Apps to render vector graphics such as lines, curves, and figures as well as text onto raster images.\n\n      Aspose.Drawing is a pure .NET library that does not rely on any external native rendering engine. It allows to run your existing C# and VB Apps on various supported platforms having identical rendering results. Aspose.Drawing for .NET can be used in .NET Framework, .NET Core or Xamarin applications in Windows, Linux, Android, Azure Functions or Blazor WebAssembly. It can be safely run from any restricted environment such as Windows or ASP.NET service.\n\n      With Aspose.Drawing you can create bitmaps from scratch or load from existing files; draw lines, Bézier curves, splines, arcs, rectangles, polygons, eclipses, etc.; work with graphics paths; render text with different fonts and styles. It allows using different pen widths and styles; solid, texture, gradient and hatch brushes; clipping regions and matrix transformations. Images are stored in memory as managed arrays of pixels and can be saved in various image formats including BMP, PNG, JPEG, GIF, and TIFF.",
