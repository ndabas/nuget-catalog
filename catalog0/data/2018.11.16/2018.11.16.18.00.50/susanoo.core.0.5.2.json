  "releaseNotes": "This release changes the way the expression tree performs mapping from the previous method of a single object approach to a comprehensive result set approach. Performance changes weren't as great as I had hoped, but I did see markedly less CPU usage in System.Data which was nice since Susanoo is one of the least resource intensive mappers out there now. Additionally, Murmur3 128bit hashing reduces performance loss in dynamically defined commands and improved support for named processors all but eliminates a performance loss.\n\nChanges in this release:\n•Improved upon last release's dynamically defined commands with Murmur3 hashing over FNV-1a.\n•Named processor support improved upon and incorporated into dynamic commands.\n•Slight performance increase and CPU usage decrease due to the more efficient expression tree.\n•Requested: Debugging capabilities. (Cast result set to IResultSet to see what columns were available.)\n",
