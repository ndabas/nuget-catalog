  "description": "FuzzyString is a library developed for use in my day job for reconciling naming conventions between different models of the electric grid. I have stripped off the power system specific code and put together what can effectively be used as a string extension for determining approximate equality between two strings. All of the algorithms used here have been pulled from online resources, translated into C#, and compiled into this library. I found several other similar open-source implementations around but nothing for .NET/C#. Adding the *.dll to your project will give you access to this extension and the individual extensions under the hood of the ApproximatelyEquals() extension.\n\nAlgorithms included in this project:\nHamming Distance\nJaccard Distance\nJaro Distance\nJaro-Winkler Distance\nLevenshtein Distance\nLongest Common Subsequence\nLongest Common Substring\nOverlap Coefficient\nRatcliff-Obershelp Similarity\nSorensen-Dice Distance\nTanimoto Coefficient",
