  "description": "A data visualization is a visual representation of data. It could be a bar chart, cross tab or a gauge. It could also just be a plain white number on a colored background.\n\nTraditionally, TARGIT Analysis Suite has provided several standard data visualizations, such as the ones mentioned above. After selecting measures and dimensions for a data object, switching between such standard data visualizations has always been quick and easy.\n\nShould you wish to view your data as, say, a pie chart that looks like an actual real-world pie or as a bunch of green pulsating dots on an animated radar screen, you would not have been unable to do. Until now.\n\nCreating and using custom data visualizations is made available for C# developers through our TARGIT Data Visualizations NuGet package, free of charge.\n\nThrough our visualizations API, a C# developer can create custom data object types that literally look like anything you could think of, and effortlessly make them available to end users of TARGIT Analysis Suite.",
