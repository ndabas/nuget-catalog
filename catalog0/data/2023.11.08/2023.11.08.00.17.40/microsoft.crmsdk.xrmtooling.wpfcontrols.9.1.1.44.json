  "releaseNotes": "These assemblies require application development using the Microsoft .NET Framework 4.6.2 or later.\n\n9.1.1.44:\nUpdated for 9.1.1.x version for CrmServiceClient\n\n9.1.0.110:\nUpdated Relogin flow to prefer attempting a direct connection to the last server ( based on profile ) vs checking with Discovery first.\n- Adds the last successfully connected URL to the stored connection profile. \nUpdated Text to reflect Power Platform and Dataverse Terminology \n\n9.1.0.88:\nUpdated CrmServiceClient dependency\n\n9.1.0.86:\nUpdated Display name for Northamerica 2 Region to reflect that it is more commonly know as GCC. \nUpdated Newtonsoft.Json to v11.0.2 to match Dataverse server.\n\n9.1.0.79:\nNo changes\n\n9.1.0.77:\nAdded support to auto retry 503 server unavailable network errors\n\n9.1.0.68: \nNo changes\n\n9.1.0.63:           \nAdded new public property for OrganizationDetail Information called \"OrganizationDetail\" for the currently connected environment.\nAdded new enum for ImportSolution additional property options called \"ImportSolutionProperties\" - this contains valid options for additional properties for the ImportSolution handler\nAdding Switzerland Geo to Regions List.\nNo updates. \n\n9.1.0.51:\nAdded initial support for in memory log capture support. \n\n9.1.0.49:\nFixed an issue with sovereign cloud discovery reference data that would prevent a login control from picking the correct global discovery server when connecting.\n\n9.1.0.44:\nNo feature changes in this release\n\n9.1.0.39:\nCorrecting an internally Nuget dependency issue.  No Public changes\nUptaking new CoreSDK release\n\n9.1.0.38:\nUptaking new CoreSDK release\n\n9.1.0.37:\nInternal fixes to unify the way in which online and onprem instances were determined from the URI provided.\n\n9.1.0.26:\nUpdated CRMSDK baseline dependancy to match what is currently required for this assembly to function correctly\nFixed a bug that would prevent logs from being generated even when verbose tracing was enabled.\n\n9.1.0.25:\nModified the Instance List to report Friendly Name and Url Host name in the display.  This should make it easier to associate the instance you are connecting to the web uri of the instance\n\n9.1.0.21:\nFixed a bug with how errors are handled when they are raised from ADAL 3.19+.  MFA Force Login will now work properly again.\nAdded 3 new GEO's to Selection List.\nRegion Name - RegionCode:\nUnited Arab Emirates - UAE\nSouth Africa - ZAF\nGermany (Go Local) - GER\n\n9.1.0.17:\nUpdating 9.1.0.8833 CDS/XRM release\nUpdated default response sizes to support more verbose error messages from CDS\n\n9.1.0.13:\nAdded Support for Current User ID login when using Online flows with oAuth\n**BREAKING CHANGE**\nADAL 3.19+ is now required for this library.  ADAL 2.x clients will need to be updated to use ADAL 3.x+\n\n9.0.2.25:\nAdded support for France and New US Geo's\nAdded new behavior to return the full login error when initial connect fails in LastException.\nFixed https activation issue introduced by .net 4.8. - This should no longer require http activation to be enabled on windows.\nFixed issue where a long running cloned connection loses its access token.\n\n9.0.2.16:\nAdded native support for handing throttling messages from server.\n\n9.0.2.14:\nAdded Support for China Geo\nMinor changes to logging of Import Solution Activities\n\n9.0.2.12:\nCorrecting Dependancy Info on Package\nFixed bug in CrmServiceClient which would cause some OnPrem connections to fail with an error \"Item already added to List\"\nMinor Pref Improvements\n9.0.2.11:\nUpdated to include Fixed version of CrmServiceClient and login control for new US Geo ( US Gov High )\n\n9.0.2.9:\nPicked up updated CrmServiceClient (Microsoft.Xrm.Tooling.Connector)\n.Net 4.6.2 is now required for this assembly.\nAdded resiliency to \"GET\" operations in the API to improve API reliability.\nAdded Support for new GEO,  \"USGov High\" with deploymentRegion=USGov\nMajor cleanup pass on logging of errors,  Error logging should be more concise now.\nUpdated HighContrast UX layout for accessibility\n\n9.0.2.8:\nPicked up updated CrmServiceClient (Microsoft.Xrm.Tooling.Connector)\n\n9.0.2.7:\nFixed a bug that would occur when using oAuth based login where the same user windows session  ( login to windows ) was used to then connect to more than one user of CDS/CRM in the same domain.\nExample of failure:\nuser contoso\\Jdoe (shared account) is used to login into a windows desktop.\nOn that desktop cdsuser1@contoso.com is used to login into CDS,  then a second application is lauched and the user cdsuser2@contoso.com is used to login into CDS.\nThis would result in login failure for the second user with a error indicating that ADAL could not determine which token to use to login.\nFixed a bug in ExecuteCrmWebRequest where some http success codes would be incorrectly seen as a fault.\n\nUpdated behavior to block use of token cache files when the setting CacheCredentials = false\n\n9.0.2.5:\nFixed a bug with using ExecuteCrmWebRequest where SkipDiscovery was also used that would cause the command to fail with a malformed URI error.\nFix to support SSO login, issue manifested as unable to execute a SSO login on second attempt.\nFix to make local metadata cache instance aware,\nIssue manifested in a single client process where more then one connection was made to different CDS instances and the metadata helpers were used.  The Metadata would not be instance specific.\n\nStreamlined .Clone support by removing unneeded WhoAmI validation call.\nAdded new .Clone override to allow a developer to pass an assembly reference to the .Clone method to use when establishing strong types for that connection.\nAdded addition error log details when a fault is detected\nAdded settings to control inline retry of requests when request is failed due to a network related issue.\nApiOperationRetryCountOverride - count of retries before the connection gives up.  default is 3.\nApiOperationRetryDelayOverride - Time the system waits between retries in seconds.  default is 1.\n\n9.0.2.4:\nAdded support for retrying SDK request if the server throws a retriable errors.\nGlobal Discovery is now preferred for all commercial regions as part of logon.\nThis will remove the \"Screen pops\" that chain pop when choosing \"Don’t Know\" for your region.\n\n9.0.2.3:\nUpdated with Xrm.Tooling.Connector support - See Notes for this module for details.\nAdded support for Skiping discovery using an app.config app setting entry called \"SkipDiscovery\" with a value of True\nNote: This will require you to enter the base URL of the instance your trying to connect to.\nApplies to Online Connections only.\nIntended for Microsoft Use only. Documented here for troubleshooting support when required.\n\n9.0.0.7: Fixed to allow External Authentication Type to function in released versions of Xrm.Tooling.Connector.dll\n9.0.0.5: 9.0 Initial Release\n9.0.0.2-preview:\nImproved cache system for faster reconnects.\nNew interfaces to support certificate based auth.\nAdded support to skip discovery\nAdded Clone connection support of OAuth based connections\nAdded New Authentication type to support externally hosted auth.\n**Note: Interface for Xrm.Tooling.Connector is *NOT* Final. there are new API interfaces that will be surfaced before GA.\n\n8.2.0.5:\nFix to memory leak in Microsoft.Xrm.Tooling.Connector.TraceLoggerBase.  Trace Listener collection would not be released within a process over a very long time frame over multiple connections. This would manifest as increasing memory consumption over a very long period.\nFix cleans this up on the .dispose() call on the CrmServiceClient.\nNote: if you have built your own logger based on the Microsoft.Xrm.Tooling.Connector.TraceLoggerBase, you must call .dispose() when you are done with it to clean up the listener collection assigned to it.\n\n8.2.0.4: Added Support for United Kingdom CRM GEO\n8.2.0.2: Fix of dependency issue in nuget package. Now properly requires .net 4.5.2 as a baseline\n8.2.0.1: Assembly version changed to 2.2.0.0\nFixes:\nMany Accessibility fixes for screen readers.\nAdded:\nNew Function: CultureUtils.SetDisplayCulture(LCID),  This function provides support to relay out the UX based on localization needs ( RTL support )\n\n8.1.0: CRM Online 2016 Update 1\n8.0.2: UR1 (Update Rollup 1)\n8.0.0: RTM",
