  "description": "Prig(PRototyping jIG) is a framework that generates a Test Double like Microsoft Fakes/Typemock Isolator/Telerik JustMock based on Unmanaged Profiler APIs. This framework enables that any methods are replaced with mocks. For example, a static property, a private method, a non-virtual member and so on.",

  "releaseNotes": "Version 0.0.0-alpha5\n* Pre-release 5.\n* Fixed Issue #9: `Add-PrigAssembly -AssemblyFrom` went dead.\n* Fixed Issue #10: `prig -p ConsoleApplication1.exe` went dead.\n* Fixed Issue #11: In .NET 3.5, the assembly containing dynamic methods can't be called indirectly.\n\n\nVersion 0.0.0-alpha4\n* Pre-release 4.\n* Supported the feature to generate the stub for one runtime instance.\n* [NOTICE] Changed the generated stub's API. It became a static method from a nested type. For example, until previous, the stub against `System.DateTime.Now` was `System.Prig.PDateTime.NowGet.Body`. From now, the stub becomes `System.Prig.PDateTime.NowGet().Body`. Because the previous version can't propagate an instance.\n* Fixed Issue #6: Methods defined in `.exe` can't be called indirectly.\n* Fixed Issue #7: Path to `tools` become unreachable from the Package Manager Console after building a project.\n* Fixed Issue #8: Against the method that contains a nested type, indirection stub can't be created.\n\n\nVersion 0.0.0-alpha3\n* Pre-release 3.\n* Fixed Issue #3: Test is freezed when hijacking the method to add an event handler.\n* Fixed Issue #4: Multiple Prig assemblies can't be added.\n* Fixed Issue #5: Build was failed when adding Prig assembly for 3rd party library.\n\n\nVersion 0.0.0-alpha2\n* Pre-release 2.\n* In Add-PrigAssembly command, added the feature to enable that the full path to stubbing assembly is specified. This will allow that you can add Prig Assembly that is not registered to GAC.\n* Added support for generating constraints of generic parameters automatically.\n* Fixed Issue #1: BadImageFormatException occurred.\n* Fixed Issue #2: Shall the name attribute be unique in the Stub Setting?\n\n\nVersion 0.0.0-alpha1\n* Pre-release 1.\n* Limited Support for NuGet.",
