  "releaseNotes": "+ The QueryBuilder control has got the new controls as dockable panels located to the left or right of the Design Pane. \n+ The new the Sub-query Navigation Bar has been made. It was formerly available as a pop-up window of the Query Navigation Bar. (Available as a separate control in the Professional subscriptions only)\n+ Usability of the Sub-query Navigation Bar is improved: now you can change the order of union sub-queries using drag'n'drop.\n+ The new Properties Bar allows you to set various query, datasource and link properties without the need to open a dialog window. (Available as a separate control in the Professional subscriptions only)\n+ The new Dock Manager control has been added. (Available in the Professional subscriptions only)\n+ The new properties have been added to the QueryBuilder.PanesConfigurationOptions: SubQueryNavBarEnabled, PropertiesBarEnabled, SubQueryNavBarDockOptions, PropertiesBarDockOptions. The two latter property groups determine the initial state of appropriate sidebar panels and contain the following properties: AutoHide (True/False), Position (Left/Right).\n+ The new property QueryBuilder.DockPanelsLayoutXML has been made to save the layout of sidebar panels between work sessions.\n+ The new properties have been added to the QueryBuilder.VisualOptions to define colors and font of sidebar panels and its docking system.\n= The Query, Datasource, and Link Properties dialogs are redesigned.\n+ Query Transformer is now capable of renaming output query columns.\n+ The new QueryTransformer.RenameDuplicatedColumns property prescribes to explicitly specify all the columns in the query SELECT list by expanding the asterisk items, then find and rename the unnamed and duplicated column names (default = false).\n+ The new QueryTransformer.AlwaysExpandColumnsInQuery instructs to perform asterisk expansion in the query SELECT list even if it's not needed for the specified query transformations (default = false).\n! The OutputColumn.Name property has been renamed to OriginalName.\n+ The new OutputColumn.PreassignedName allows specifying the needed name for a query output column.\n+ The new OutputColumn.ResultName gets the result query columns name, which turned out as a result of automatic columns renaming routine and manual appliance of the new name specified via the PreassignedName property.\n+ Localization in the separate controls mode has been fixed.\n= The QueryBuilder.Language and QueryView.Language properties are reflections for the global ActiveQueryBuilder.Core.Helpers.Localizer.Language property.\n= Batch query column items processing on grouping on/off has been made.\n- QueryTransformer: The bug with incorrect ORDER BY generation if column alias is the same as field name has been fixed.\n= QueryTransformer: The new SQLGenerationOptions property has been added, the SQLBuilder property has been removed.\n= The InvalidOperationException is thrown now if both MetadataItem.MetadataName and MetadataItem.MetadataObject properties are specified.\n- The bug on resizing QueryColumnList control if cell editor is active has been fixed.\n- The bug with not displaying fields from derived tables in the Expression Editor's tree has been fixed.\n+ PostgreSQL: Support of custom aggregate functions has been made.\n- MS SQL Server: CHAR and NCHAR, ROW and ROWS are added to the list of valid identifiers.\n- Firebird: The simple form of the TRIM function is supported now.\n- Oracle: Special form of the TRIM function is supported now.\n- Localization in the separate controls mode has been fixed.",
