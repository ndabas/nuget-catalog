  "description": "When using the default PictureBox in a Windows.Forms, it is often helpful to know what relative pixel of the image the mouse is currently over. Since the position returned in mouse events for the control are relative to the control's base, the position over the image can be vastly different, depending on how the SizeMode property is set. This class helps resolve these differences.",
