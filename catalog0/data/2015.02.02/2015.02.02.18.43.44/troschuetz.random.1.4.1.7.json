  "description": "Fully managed library providing various random number generators and distributions.\n      More precisely, this library offers four generators (ALF, MT19937, Standard, XorShift128), five discrete distributions (Bernoulli, Binomial, DiscreteUniform, Geometric, Poisson) and twenty continuous distributions (like Normal, Exponential and so on); moreover, it offers a Python-style random class (TRandom).\n      All the hard work behind this library was done by Stefan Troschütz, and for which I thank him very much. What I am doing with his great project, is simply to refactor and improve his code, while offering the new Python-style random class.\n      You can find the modified source code and the available documentation at this address: http://goo.gl/vIV2G",

  "releaseNotes": "This can be considered a stable release, excluding the class TRandom, which is new and incomplete.\n      As of 1.4.1.7, TRandom exposes all other distributions, is more documented and tested.\n      WARNING: Until further notice, class TRandom has to be considered not so stable.\n      WARNING: This package is young, and the owner is quite new to the NuGet system. If you find any problem, please contact the owner.",
