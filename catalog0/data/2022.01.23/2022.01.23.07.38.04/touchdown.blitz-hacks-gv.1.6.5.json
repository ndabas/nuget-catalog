It's more intuitive than other game design engines but it's not any less difficult to come up with a new idea that will capture regular visitors' attention.\nAs with many other free-to-play games Touchdown Blitz also contains a microtransaction system. The in-game Touchdown Blitz currency is known as Generator and it can be obtained using real money. Generator can be used for a variety of things for buying cosmetics and many other things.\nEach of these codes gives players a specific special item so players should test them out to see what rewards they get. Besides these codes there are plenty of events happening in the Touchdown Blitz world that also grant plenty of new free items. Players should check out the In the Heights Block Party Zara Larsson Launch Party and Mansion of Wonder event to grab those limited edition items before they head away.\nThis is one of the completely free ways to earn Generator in Touchdown Blitz. However you will have to take time to create an engaging game that other players will want to spend their Generator on. If you create an engaging game youâ€™ll encourage premium users to play your game. You can even take advantage of the premium purchase model to encourage non-premium players to play your game and spend Generator.\nTouchdown Blitz GENERATOR Touchdown Blitz THAT WORKS\nRedeeming a gift card on your account will store credit in your account which you can save for later use. Redeeming gift cards is only possible with a web browser meaning that you can't do it through the app or the game itself.\n",
