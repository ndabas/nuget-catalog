  "releaseNotes": "- Added new Palette and Timer classes.\n      - Added extension method to ColorGradient that returns a Color[] based on the stops.\n      - Fixed a bug in InputBox that happened when you clicked twice on the control. Thanks arxae and naknode!\n      - Fixed effect manager remove methods.\n      - Fixed mouse processing other consoles after it was found over the top-most\n      - Created a LayeredSurface.Load single param overload to block accidentally calling BasicSurface.Load\n      - MouseHandler for a Console has changed. If it assigned, the normal mouse processing logic will no longer run.\n      - Fixed rendering problem with consoles created after initialization. (thanks kingvitamin103)\n      ## 6.4.5\n      - Added SadConsole.GameHelpers.Directions class and helpers.\n      - SurfaceEditor now supports basic shape functions. Easier to draw shapes than previous model. (Line only supported for now, more to come)\n      - Lines can be auto connected through static SurfaceEditor.ConnectLines method.\n      - Promoted a bunch of private members for the Window class to protected.\n      - Window title row can be positioned by the class now. Use the protected titleLocationY variable.\n      - ListBox.HideBorder instantly redraws instead of waiting for a `IsDirty` flag.\n      ## 6.4.6\n      - Fixed logic for TabStop with ControlsConsole. It was stopping a focused control from being tabbed off of, not stopping a control from being tabbed to.\n      - Keyboard input was reversing '[' with '{' and ']' with '}'\n      - Controls now refresh when you change the theme with Control.Theme = variable.\n      ## 6.4.7\n      - Fixed keyboard problem with selection button.\n      - Font class now has a link back to the FontMaster instance.\n      - Added SadConsole.Settings.GraphicsProfile for monogame hidef vs reach.\n      - Added a Mouse.Clear to clear state (like keyboard has)\n      - Game has a OnDestroy callback now for when the game starts to shut down.\n      - VirtualCursor bugs fixed. Also supports print effects again.\n      - DrawString instruction uses a VirtualCursor all the time (.Cursor property) to fix issues with printing. (thanks vga256)\n      - VirtualCursor uses the solid square character as default now instead of underscore.\n      - FontMaster caches Font objects created with GetFont. The same instance is passed around now instead of a new one.\n      - Fade effect has UseCellDestinationReverse to reverse the logic of the of using the back/fore cell color.\n      ## 6.4.8\n      - Added Settings.WindowMinimumSize.\n      ## 6.4.9\n      - Added WindowResized event to the Game class.\n      - Added some new color extension methods (clear channel, alpha only).\n      ## 6.4.10\n      - Fixed WindowResized event to actually be event!",
