  "releaseNotes": "v2.2.0 (Released May 4th, 2018)\nNew Functions\n1. Play the audio effect in the channel\nAdded a publish parameter in the playEffect method enabling the remote user in the channel to hear the audio effect played locally. For details, see the description for playEffect in Video Call API.\n\nNote\n\nIf your SDK is upgraded to v2.2 from a previous version, pay attention to the function changes of this API.\n\n2. Deploy the proxy at the server\nAgora provides a proxy package for enterprise users with corporate firewalls to deploy before accessing the services of Agora. For details, see Advanced: Deploying the Enterprise Proxy.\n\n3. Get the remote video state\nAdded the remoteVideoStateChangedOfUid method to get the state of the remote video stream. For details, see the description for remoteVideoStateChangedOfUid in Video Call API.\n\n4. Add watermarks on the broadcasting video\nAdded the watermark function enabling users to add a PNG file to the local or CDN broadcast as a watermark. Added the addVideoWatermark and clearVideoWatermarks APIs to add and delete watermarks in a local live broadcast. The watermark parameter in the LiveTranscording interface enables watermarks in CDN broadcasts. For details, see the descriptions for addVideoWatermark, clearVideoWatermarks, and LiveTranscoding in Interactive Broadcast API.\n\nImprovements\n1. Audio volume indication\nImproved the enableAudioVolumeIndication function. The method, once enabled, sends the audio volume indication of the speaker in its callback at set intervals, regardless of whether any user is speaking in the channel.\n\n2. Network quality detection during a session\nTo meet the customers’ need for real-time network quality detection in the channel, the onNetworkQuality method has improved its data accuracy. For more information, see descriptions about onNetworkQuality in Video Call API .\n\n3. Lastmile quality detection before joining a channel\nTo test if the customers’ network condition can support audio or video calls before joining the channel, onLastmileQuality has changed its detection base from a fixed bitrate to the bitrate set by the customer in videoProfile to improve data accuracy. When the network condition is unknown, this callback is still triggered at a time interval of 2 seconds. For more information, see descriptions about onLastmileQuality in Video Call API .\n\n4. Audio Quality Enhancement\nImproved the audio quality in scenarios that involve music playing. To achieve high-fidelity music play, you can set Scenario：AgoraAudioScenarioGameStreaming = 3 in the setAudioProfile API. For details, see descriptions on setAudioProfile in Video Call API .\n\n5. Bitcode support\nAdded support for Bitcode, which enables App optimization and thinning by the App Store. The package size of the Bitcode SDK is 2.5 times that of the normal one.\n\nIssues Fixed\nFixed occasional screen display abnormalities when the iOS device sets its video in the landscape mode.\nFixed occasional screen display abnormalities when a large number of audience join host in the live-broadcast channel.\nFixed occasional echo issues caused by some iOS device.\n\norigin: https://docs.agora.io/en/2.2/product/Video/Product%20Overview/release_ios_video",
