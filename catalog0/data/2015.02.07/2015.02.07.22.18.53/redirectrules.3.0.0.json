  "description": "Package for common Redirect rules.\nMeant for Umbraco sites, but can be used on any site with Rewrite Module for IIS.\nFeatures that makes is package great.\n• No 301 chaining. You only redirect once, no matter how many things are wrong with the URL.\n• Topdomains are enforced with prefixed www.\n• Subdomains are enforced with no prefix of www.\n• Whitelist of urls that are not meant to be transformed. This is meant for API's, Ajax calls or backend framework such as Umbraco.\n\nKnown issues:\n• Domains with additional punctuation marks won't work as expected, unless as a subdomain.\n• Domains such as mysite.co.uk won't work as expected because of the additional punctuation mark is counted as a subdomain.",
