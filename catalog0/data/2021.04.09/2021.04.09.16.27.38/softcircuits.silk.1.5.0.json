  "description": "The Simple Interpreted Language Kit (SILK) is a .NET class library that makes it easy to add scripting and automation to your .NET applications.\n\nThe library includes three main components. A compiler, a compiled program, and a runtime. The compiler compiles the Silk source code to bytecode. This allows faster execution and also catches all source code syntax errors before running the Silk program.\n\nThe compiler produces a compiled program. A compiled program can be saved to a file, and later read from a file. This allows you to load and run a Silk program without recompiling it each time.\n\nFinally, the runtime component can execute a compiled program.\n\nThe main power of this library is that it allows you to register your own functions and variables with the compiler and those functions and variables can be called from the Silk program. When one of your registered functions is called, the Function event is raised, allowing the host application to provide key functionality specific to the host application's domain.\n\nThe Silk language itself is designed to be relatively easy to learn. It has no semicolons or other excessive punctuation, it's not case sensitive and is very flexible about expressions involving mixed data types.\n\nThe library now includes support for .NET 5 and nullable reference types.",

  "releaseNotes": "- Library now includes support for .NET 5 and nullable reference types\n- Added static method CompiledProgram.FromFile()\n- Added many overloads to Compiler.Compile(), including ones that accept streams or the source code as a string\n- Added break keyword\n- Added continue keyword\n- Fixed compiler issue that didn't handle expressions that start with two minuses and left parentheses such as -(-(2 + 1))\n- Added support for expressions with multiple array indexes, like array[i][j][k]\n- Reworked Variable comparison code to make more consistent and smarter about comparing mixed types\n- Variables registered by host application now read-only by default, but can be made writable\n- Added Variable.CompareTo() methods\n- Added intrinsic function Pow()\n- Added optional decimals parameter to Round() intrinsic function\n- Added intrinsic variables True and False\n- Removed intrinsic variables PI and E\n- Added automated unit tests\n- Added additional test programs\n- Minor tweaks and enhancements",
