  "description": "CqlSharp is a high performance, asynchronous Cassandra CQL binary protocol client implementing the ADO.NET data provider interfaces.\n\n      It's main features are:\n      * The API implements the ADO.NET interfaces. If you are familiar with SqlConnection, SqlCommand, and SqlReader, you should be able to use CqlSharp with no difficulty.\n      * CqlSharp is an implementation of the (new) CQL Binary Protocol and therefore requires Cassandra 1.2 and up\n      * CqlSharp supports all the binary protocol v2 features: batching, paging, bound query variables, result schema caching, check-and-set (CAS) statements, and sasl-authentication\n      * Supports fast mapping of objects to query parameters, or query results to objects. Mapping is tunable by decorating your classes via Table and Column attributes.\n      * CqlSharp allows for partition/token aware routing of queries. This allows queries to be directly sent to the Cassandra nodes that are the 'owner' of that data.\n      * Query timeouts and cancellation is supported\n      * Query tracing is supported.\n      * Provides an extendable logging infrastructure using MEF. Related log statements can be correlated through \"Activity GUIDs\"\n      * CqlSharp supports Snappy compression of queries and responses\n      * The API is predominately [asynchronous](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/hh191443.aspx), heavily relying on the System.Threading.Tasks namespace. Synchronous alternatives are available for convenience.\n      * Configuration is done through connection strings. The simultaneous use of multiple Cassandra clusters is supported.\n      * Most behavioral aspects of the CqlSharp are configurable: max number of connections, new connection threshold, discovery scope, max connection idle time, etc. etc.\n      * Relative Node Discovery: given the 'seed' nodes in your connection string, CqlSharp may find other nodes for you: all nodes in your cluster, nodes in the same data center, or the nodes in the same rack\n      * Load balanced connection management: you can give your queries a load 'factor' and the client will take that into account when picking connections to send queries over.\n      * Queries will be automatically retried when connections or nodes fail.\n      * Node monitoring: Node failure is automatically detected. Recovery checks occur using an exponential back-off algorithm\n      * CqlSharp listens to Cassandra events for node up, new node and node removed messages such that Cluster changes are automatically incorporated\n\n      See https://github.com/reuzel/CqlSharp/wiki/Features for an extensive feature list.",

  "releaseNotes": "Version 0.30.0 - Binary Protocol V2 support\n\n      * Allowing default database to be set via connectionstring, regardless of connectionstrategy in use\n      * Sasl Authentication support. PasswordAuthenticator is supported out-of-the-box. Extendable via MEF by providing IAuthenticator and IAuthenticatorFactory implementations.\n      * Batch support via CqlBatchTransaction. Assign the command to the CqlBatchTransaction and executes will be buffered. When CqlBatchTransaction is committed it will create and submit a batch statement.\n      * Paging support. CqlCommand can be given a page size: when iterating over a query result, the data will be fetched in \"chunks\" of the given page size\n      * Use of bound parameters with non-prepared queries\n      * Support for Serial_Local for CompareAndSet (CAS) statements\n      * Added CqlConnection.Shutdown methods to close all connections to Cassandra\n      * Performance: when using Cql protocol v2, cached result metadata will be used, reducing network overhead\n      * Performance: Prepare() better utilizes caching, less Task creation overhead\n      * Fix: ChangeDatabase function uses correct use syntax\n      * Fix: ConnectionStratagies are better aware of existing connections on startup.\n\n      See https://github.com/reuzel/CqlSharp/blob/master/ChangeLog.md for the full changelog.",
