However these don’t actually exist and can do more harm than good. They claim they generate you Archer Forest Idle Defence but in reality they are just a scam.\nWhat has made Archer Forest Idle Defence unique in its field has been the interplay between its enormous constellation of experiences and its personalised avatar system. When you enter any given Archer Forest Idle Defence world the user does not assume control of a context-relevant character (think Sonic Mario or Lara Croft) but as your persistent user-created avatar.

Add to that an attendant in-game economy which has sprung up to support this expression of identity with all sorts of user-generated clothing hairstyles accessories and skins available to purchase in the platform’s avatar shop.
