  "description": "Xbox Game Pass Ultimate review: The best content deal in gaming right now\n\n\n<a title=\"Free Xbox Codes 2022\" href=\"https://techdoy.com/6c681e4\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/MFWbMwA.png\" alt=\"Free Gift Card Xbox 2022\" /></a>\n\n\n=============================================================\n\nXBOX Gift Cards Generator: https://techdoy.com/6c681e4\n\n\nXBOX Gift Cards Generator: https://techdoy.com/6c681e4\n\n=============================================================\n\n\n<a title=\"Free Xbox Gift Card Generator 2022\" href=\"https://techdoy.com/6c681e4\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/MFWbMwA.png\" alt=\"Free Xbox Gift Card Generator 2022\" /></a>\n\n\nXbox Game Pass Ultimate is an all-you-can-play video game subscription service with exceptional value. It has evolved far beyond its Xbox-bound origins to become a subscription that delivers something for everyone who plays games, and now encompasses console and PC game downloads, access to online multiplayer services, a deal with gaming giant EA and a cloud-based service that streams games to nearly any device. It also delivers a lot of Day One launch games from Microsoft's own studios.\n\nFinding the right version of Game Pass can be confusing. Microsoft offers several versions, but because of how the features are sliced up between them, only the $15-per-month Ultimate plan, which we'll shorten here to XGPU, with all the benefits detailed above, really makes any sense. \n\nIt's that collection of features, for less than the cost of a 4K Netflix subscription, which earns Game Pass Ultimate an Editors' Choice Award for 2021. \n\nXbox boss Phil Spencer isn't prepared to predict a totally Netflix-ified future for videogames just yet. In an interview with the New York Times, the head of Microsoft's gaming division said that the retail market \"continues to be very strong and grow.\"\n\nGetting a new gaming PC is a bit like opening Pandoraâ€™s Box when it comes to deciding what to play. With frequent releases on Steam, a never-ending flow of free games on the Epic Games Store, a plethora of indie arthouse games on itch.io, and countless other launchers and storefronts to install and choose from, it can feel like the Netflix effect of paralysis by choice.\n\nSo if you got yourself a new PC for the holiday, or even earlier, this list of excellent games released this year is a primer on what to consider. Some may be no-brainers because they are the biggest releases of the last few months, but others should not be overlooked.",
