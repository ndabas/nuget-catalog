  "description": "The IAM Cloud SSO Toolkit is a very handy tool for developers and IT pros, to help remove burden of integrating enterprise-grade Identity & Access Management to any Line-of-Business application. Our Toolkit allows developers and IT Pros to focus instead on their own area of expertise, knowing the IAM is being handled by our technology.\nWith astonishingly little effort, organizations now can integrate Single Sign-On into their existing range of applications. Our Toolkit can be used for both desktop and web based applications. The Toolkit has powerful yet simple user-friendly interface, meaning programmers can make the most of our technology without being an identity expert.\nWe have built the SSO Toolkit on top of IAM Cloudâ€™s powerful identity engine, allowing applications to accept users from an enormous range of different sources and repositories, including Active Directory, WorkDay, PeopleSoft, SQL, Oracle and many more.\nAuthentication is achieved, we then respond with expected attributes directly from our Cloud Vault. Using our Toolkit these can then be consumed within your application exactly like any other dataset.",
