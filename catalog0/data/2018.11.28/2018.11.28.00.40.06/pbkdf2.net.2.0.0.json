  "description": "PBKDF2.NET provides adaptive password-based key derivation functionality (PBKDF2) for the .NET Framework.\n\nIt adheres to the suggested PBKDF2 implementation while also holding true to the .NET cryptographic programming model. This is done to ensure smooth transition for users of this library and reducing the amount of refactoring involved to integrate this library into existing source.\n\nFor details on how to use this library, please refer to the project site at:\n\n http://therealmagicmike.github.io/PBKDF2.NET/\n\nThis library and it's source is licensed under the MIT License, which is included with this download.\n\nFull source code and documentation is available at:\n\n http://github.com/therealmagicmike/PBKDF2.NET",

  "releaseNotes": "***** Change Log *****\n\n  v2.0.0.0\n========================\nThe following changes were introduced in this release:\n\n* improved type interface for all types in lib\n* some names of public properties on types were changed drastically from version 1\n* library (.dll) naming convention has been changed to provide smoother transitions in future releases\n Details: The naming convention of this library is now simply \"PBKDF2.NET\". Revisions to the source\n structuring to accommodate possible builds targeting specific framework versions.\n* internal initialization process has changed within the System.Security.Cryptography.PBKDF2 class.\n Details: This was done both for performance-tuning reasons and to accommodate the addition of byte[]\n Password public property being added to the type to be treated like a Key property. These changes were\n necessary to integrate these changes with the internal state management of PBKDF2 objects.",
