  "description": "Free CP in COD Mobile 2021 no human verification:\n\nCOD hack Aimbotting is certainly one of the most popular hacks in every online shooters, because it essentially allows players to get kills without trying. An aimbot will automatically track enemies and fire whenever they're in view, meaning it's almost impossible to kill someone who's aimbotting since they'll always know what your location is and don't miss a shot. In the same fashion to aimbots – both in many cases are coupled together – wallhacks enable you to see enemies through walls. Some will highlight extra information about the ball player you're tracking like simply how much health they've, and a wallhack is also harder to detect than aimbot, which makes it a favorite selection for those buying a smaller advantage.\n\n\nVISIT HERE >>>> https://rebrand.ly/cod-mobile-new\n\n\nA radar hack in COD Mobile virtually does what it says on the tin: hacks the radar/minimap so player locations become visible at all times.
