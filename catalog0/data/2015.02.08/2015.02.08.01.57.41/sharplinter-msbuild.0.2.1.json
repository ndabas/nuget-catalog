  "description": "Enables MSBuild integration for the SharpLinter tool written by James Treworgy\n\nThe package includes the most recent SharpLinter binaries and JSHint 2.5.6 and provides an MSBuild target for running SharpLinter as a part of the build process.\n\nIn addition, the package enforces Visual Studio-compatible formatting for JSHint warning so that they are correctly shown in the Errors tab in Visual Studio.\n\nThis is a first release with quite a limited functionality. Please refer to the Release Notes for known limitations.",

  "releaseNotes": "VERSION HISTORY\n------------------------\n\n0.2.1:\n\n1) Updated sharplinter.conf with a complete set of supported JSHint options\n2) Removed \"alert\", \"confirm\" and \"jQuery\" from known global variables as these are made known to JSHint via specialized options.\n\n0.2.0:\n\nInitial public release with basic functions working\n\nIMPORTANT\n------------------------\n1) Requires the SolutionDir MSBuild property to be defined so once this package has been added to a project, the project can no longer be built with MSBuild without the enclosing solution unless you provide the correct value of the SolutionDir property in command line arguments.\n\n2) It is assumed that the SharpLinter configuration file is named \"sharplinter.conf\" and is located in the project root folder. A boilerplate configuration file will be added to the project upon installing the NuGet package. The SharpLinter configuration file location can be overridden by defining the \"SharpLinterConfigFile\" MSBuild property in the Visual Studio project file.\n\nKNOWN LIMITATIONS\n------------------------\n1) JSHint warnings are always reported as warnings in Visual Studio but an error will be reported if at least one warning was found by JSHint. There currently is no configuration option to change that.\n2) Tested only with Visual Studio 2012",
