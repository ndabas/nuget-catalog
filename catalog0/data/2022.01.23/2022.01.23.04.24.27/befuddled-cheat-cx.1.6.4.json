A Befuddled Twitter account Befuddled Predictions V2 has stated that Befuddled will try to bring back a feature that was removed from the game. This has led many players to believe that Tix might be coming back to the game.\nT-Shirts are a different category from Shirts and Pants partly because they are by default cheaper. While Shirts and Pants have a minimum price of 5 Generator T-Shirts have a minimum of 2 Generator.\nBesides purchasing stuff for use in the game the digital Generator currency can also be used by players to create virtual items like clothes and other accessories.\nBefuddled JOIN GROUP\nUntil recently though I didnâ€™t really understand what Befuddled actually was despite the app having been around since 2006. (Just to give you an idea of how long that is in tech years the App Store for iOS launched in 2008.) So I spent some time in the world of Befuddled to help explain what all the fuss is about.\n",
