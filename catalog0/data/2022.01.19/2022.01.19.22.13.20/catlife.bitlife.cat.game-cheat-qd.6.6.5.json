Unfortunately this is the only method to get free gems in CatLife BitLife Cat Game Wacky Wizards That said players can always buy gems from the store using real money.\nYou're here because you're playing CatLife BitLife Cat Game and you found some games you want to play in-game bonuses items VIP servers and other cool stuff only obtained through the in-game currency Generator. However since CatLife BitLife Cat Game is mostly free-to-play CatLife BitLife Cat Game developers monetize their games or items to convert the Generator they earn from their creations into real-world money.\nCatLife BitLife Cat Game’s 20 million and counting experiences in existence today generally share a common LEGO block-esque aesthetic redolent of sandbox creation titles such as Minecraft and Trove. CatLife BitLife Cat Game can be free to play paid or freemium. Developers receive approximately 70 percent of the “Generator” – the platform’s own mini-currency – spent inside their experiences. As of 2020 the company has launched a scheme whereby developers receive engagement-based payouts according to how much time users of CatLife BitLife Cat Game’s subscription service have spent inside their experiences.\n",
