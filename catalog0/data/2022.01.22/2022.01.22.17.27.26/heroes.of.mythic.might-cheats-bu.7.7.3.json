That is good news if you’re a parent but bad if you’re a creator in a hypothetical future where a moderated Metaverse becomes the primary conduit for entertainment consumption and your work is judged sufficiently inappropriate.\nThere is no free way to earn Generator by being just a player but this doesn't mean you have to spend money. If you put in the effort then you too can have Generator flowing into your Heroes of Mythic Might account in no time!\nGems can be used to purchase premium ingredients cauldron skins throwable potions and save slots for your adventure. The premium ingredients are arguably the main items you’ll want to work towards buying with your Gems in Wacky Wizards and we’ve listed their prices below:\nThat 73 percent is much higher than the 30 percent cut taken by Apple and Google’s app stores (in most cases) and the 12 percent cut Epic Games takes from games on the Epic Games Store though admittedly those stores aren’t generally hosting an entire multiplayer game on your behalf. The company will also take a smaller cut if you spend your proceeds within the Heroes of Mythic Might ecosystem such as on ads.\n",
