  "description": "Lumia SensorCore SDK is a collection of 4 APIs utilising data from different sensors (for example, accelerometer) and also location information. This information can be used to track user's physical activities and motion. The sensors are able to run constantly in the background, collecting and preserving data for up to past ten days. \n\n\t\tWith the Lumia SensorCore SDK one can access to step counter that provides information on how many steps and for how long time the user has been walking. The SDK also provides information about changes in user's physical activity. For example, when user remains stationary, or starts or stops walking. \n\n\t\tThe SDK also provides user location information including a list of geo-coordinates where the user has spent some time and user's home and work location and information about user's movements. \n\n\t\tLearn more about the SDK at: http://developer.nokia.com/resources/library/Lumia/sensorcore-sdk.html\n\t\tCheck out our installation guide at: http://developer.nokia.com/resources/library/Lumia/sensorcore-sdk/quick-start.html\n\n\t\tPlatform requirement: Lumia Windows Phone 8.1",
