  "description": "Fully managed library providing various random number generators and distributions.\n      All the hard work behind this library was done by Stefan Troschütz, and for which I thank him very much. What I am doing with his great project, is simply to refactor and improve his code, while offering a new Python-style random class.\n      You can find the modified source code at this address: http://goo.gl/vIV2G",
