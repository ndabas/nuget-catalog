  "description": "MvvmBindingPack is the robust platform for UX high-quality design solutions including of using IoC containers.\n MVVM pattern is widely used in developing of XAML-based GUI applications. It is impossible to provide the quality UX design implementations without using this pattern. Quality of UX design directly depends on the techniques or features that used for implementing the MVVM pattern. Clear separation of concerns between View (XAML code coupled with its code-behind) and View Model characterizes a profession level and quality of the product implementation \nDigital agencies are often involved in providing the quality UX design solutions for application products. This process is based on separated development of one application between two companies. Design agency develops View (XAML) part and Technology or Business Company concentrates on developing functional parts: View Model and Model. Here we have got a development process when two different languages XAML and C# are contracted together and delivered by different companies.",
