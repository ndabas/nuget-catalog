All of the major games do their best to combat scammers but the key thing to learn here is that if something seems too good to be true then it probably is and should be avoided. Make sure you educate your kids about scammers and they should remain safe and happy.\nA lot will offer the opportunity to use these generators without the need for filling out surveys or 'human verification'\n",
