(By comparison Fortnite’s huge Travis Scott concerts in April drew 45.8 million viewers over five shows.)\nIn the box that says ‘Enter Your Code’ players should input the code they are trying to redeem. If entering the code is followed by a green thumbs-up the redemption was successful and the items should be in the player's inventory. If entering the code is followed by a red thumbs-down icon the code is invalid meaning it is likely expired or has already been redeemed.\nEqually if you get caught using an account generated through these programs there are big consequences.
