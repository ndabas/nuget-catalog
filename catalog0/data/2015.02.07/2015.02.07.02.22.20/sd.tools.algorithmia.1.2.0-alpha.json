  "description": "Algorithm and data-structure library for .NET 3.5 and up. Algorithmia contains sophisticated algorithms and data-structures like graphs, priority queues, command, undo-redo and more.\n\nAlgorithmia is one of the pillars of LLBLGen Pro and is used in production successfully since May 2010. Many of the classes and algorithms in Algorithmia contain references to papers and articles on Wikipedia or other websites where you can find additional information regarding the algorithm or data-structure implemented.\n\nThe core design of Algorithmia is about making algorithms and data-structures which are known for many years available to the .NET developer in easy to use and properly documented classes and methods. No class or method implemented in Algorithmia re-implements a .NET BCL (base class library) class or method unless it was necessary to do so (e.g. the linked list in .NET is re-implemented as it doesn't have an O(1) concat operation, which is necessary for the Fibonacci heap).",
