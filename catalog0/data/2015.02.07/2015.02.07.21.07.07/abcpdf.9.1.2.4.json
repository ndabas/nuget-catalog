  "description": "ABCpdf is a powerful and easy to use PDF component for .NET.\n\nABCpdf is a .NET component. As such, you'll find it documented for C# and VB.NET, with numerous code examples and freely adaptable projects, all designed to help you get up to speed.\n\nRe-use existing skills to layout documents. ABCpdf supports a wide range of layout methods, including HTML and CSS, System.Drawing, PostScript, and a powerful set of native drawing commands. Import SVG, DOCX, XPS, the usual bitmap image formats such as JPEG, TIFF, and many more. And because support for these formats is built-in, ABCpdf makes light work of document conversion tasks.\n\nABCpdf is a robust component, with thousands upon thousands of live installations, and a decade's worth of support and development. But should you ever need help our developer support team are on hand to provide free support.\n\nABCpdf is fast. ABCpdf does not use a printer driver. Instead it goes Direct to PDFâ„¢, generating PDF documents on the fly. And fully multi-threaded, ABCpdf is suitable for use with ASP.NET.\n\nABCpdf supports Unicode and foreign languages, CJK fonts, and right-to-left text such as Arabic and Hebrew.\n\nDownload and try out ABCpdf for free. All our components include a 30-day trial. During the trial period, ABCpdf operates as the unrestricted Professional edition.",
