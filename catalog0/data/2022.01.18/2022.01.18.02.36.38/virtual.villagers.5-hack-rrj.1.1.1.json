But why would you” he says matter-of-factly. “In pandemic times it's easy to say that: ‘You can go online and watch movies with your mates!’ But why would I need to go online when I can just watch it on my television which is much bigger – and doesn't have little [avatars] anywhere”\nBut the “open Metaverse” Decentraland gestures towards is still very far away. Bartle the Essex academic says that today most developers are building up discrete and proprietary “walled garden” virtual worlds. “You can't move between them or take what you've got from one world into another” he says. \nThe team at Virtual Villagers 5 are well aware of how important it is to protect their users and provide a range of tools to help parents with this. These filters include who can contact and chat with any given account setting up a PIN to restrict access plus two-factor authentication.
