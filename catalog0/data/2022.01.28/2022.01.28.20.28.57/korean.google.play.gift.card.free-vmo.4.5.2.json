Prepare 5 Nuclear potions by combining 5 Giant’s ear and 5 Dynamite. Once done prepare 5 Hot potions using 5 Chilli Peppers. Gather all the potions and put them inside the cannon aiming towards Cyclops boss. Fire them one by one and decimate Mr. Rich’s entire health. Keep in mind you need to put the potions inside the cannon in quick succession as Mr. Rich will start to regenerate health if you take too long.\nKOREAN GOOGLE PLAY GIFT CARD FREE’s 20 million and counting experiences in existence today generally share a common LEGO block-esque aesthetic redolent of sandbox creation titles such as Minecraft and Trove.
