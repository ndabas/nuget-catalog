  "description": "The main goal of this library is the simplify data access for Object Oriented programmers. This library provides a simple way to perform CRUD operations. It is not expected to work for everyone or every application. Currently works with SQL Server and My Sql.\nI wanted something that would be simple to use, understand, and have very little impact on the code. With this library, you can have basic object CRUD working in less than three lines of code, and should require less than an hour to understand the library usage.\n\nI also wanted something that could easily be integrated into an existing project.\n\nThe basic concept is that you add a few attributes to your objects which explains the mapping to a database results column/s. You can also implement IDatabaseDefineSupport to provide the mapping details.\n\nThere a two main objects used to work with the database. ObjectLoader and ObjectWriter.",

  "releaseNotes": "11-Nov-2012\nAdded DeleteChild method, which allows you to delete a child and it's relation to the parent.\n\n12-18 Nov-2012\nAdded support for IChangeTrackingSupport. When an obect implements this interface\n, Symbiotic automaticly maintains a change tracking of the object. \nRequires a near duplicate table using the same name with the added \"_Hist\" .\nThe primary keys for the hist table are different; ActionType, ActionDate, Id.\n\nThe extra columns needed for the hist table are: ActionType [small int], ActionDate [small datetime], ActionUser [nvarchar(150)], ActionNotes [nvarchar(255)]\n\nAlso maintains relation table history in a *_Hist table, relation tracking tables are identical except with the added \"_Hist\" to the table name.\n\n27-Nov - 14-Dec-2012\nWorking on support for Oracle (what a pain)\n\nThis release made some interface changes to support Orcale, so it make take some time to support the new version. Please review before upgrading.",
