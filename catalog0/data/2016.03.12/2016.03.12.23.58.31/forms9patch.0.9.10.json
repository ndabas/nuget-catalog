  "description": "Xamarin Forms is great for developing apps on Android and iOS but it is missing two important tools for developers: scalable images and PCL multi-screen image management.  Android developers use NinePatch bitmaps and the drawable directory naming convention for this purpose.  Likewise, iOS developers use ResizeableImageWithCapInsets and the @2x, @3x, @4x file naming convention for this purpose.\n\nForms 9 Patch enhances Xamarin Forms to enable multi-resolution / multi-screen image management to PCL apps for iOS and Android.",
