  "releaseNotes": "This project is built on the CoAP.NET project of smeshlink which in turn is based on Californium.  As this project did not seem to be maintained any more and I wanted a version in order to test the newer items that are coming out of the IETF CORE working group, I have captured it and started exanding it.\nThis project is NOT to be used for commercial purposes.  It is intented only for research and verification work.\n\n1.1.8\n  - Rewrite the LinkFormat code - introduce a strict parsing mode and setup for doing a resource directory.\n\n1.1.7\n  - Missed the public on FileLogManager class\n  - Add method and dispatch code for dealing with FETCH, PATCH and iPATCH.  These methods were defined in RFC 8132.\n1.1.6\n  - Re-enable DTLS reliability layer.  It was removed for debugging purposes.\n  - Re-enable observer reconnect attempts.  The ability to disable it remains, this just changes the default value.\n  - Add a UriPath and UriQuery property to the CoapClient class.  This means that URIs do not need to be constantly reparsed when looking at multiple resources on a server.\n1.1.5\n  - DTLS should now check sessions correct\n  - Remove some left over Console.Write statements\n1.1.4\n  - Refer to strongly named assemblies.  These will become strongly named in the next version\n  - Updates dealing with the internal logging system so it can be made to log to a file rather than the console\n  - DTLS server implemention is now functional and included.\n1.1.3\n  - Turn off logging by default\n  - Turn off auto re-enrollment for Observe relationships by default.  The ObserveReconnect property on a request can be used to turn it back on for that request.\n1.1.2\n  - Implement a basic version of DTLS client code          \n1.1.1\n  - Correct dll name          \n1.1.0\n  - Fix internal inconsistances          \n1.0.0\n  - Add support for OSCOAP draft -02\n  - Change name space to not collide with smershlink version",
