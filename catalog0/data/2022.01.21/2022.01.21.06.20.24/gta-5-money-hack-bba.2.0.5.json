As fans, the logical thing to do would be to get excited for a new game in the series, right? Wrong, actually. Rockstar says youâ€™re going to get another re-release of a 2013 game, and youâ€™re going to like it.\n\nFirst announced back in 2020, reception for the PS5 remaster of GTA V has been very mixed. The first gameplay trailer left fans struggling to actually notice any difference between the new version and the 2015 PS4 and Xbox One ports, which yâ€™know, hardly bodes well. But despite the port not seeming to offer anything new, that didnâ€™t stop Rockstar from delaying it to March this year, soaring past the original release date of 11 November 2021. Now, it looks like it might be delayed even more.",
