If you follow the steps above and educate your kids on how to stay safe and let you know when something isn’t right they will have a great time playing any of the games on the platform. My son has even got me playing with him and this can be a great way to fully understand what it is your kids are doing.\nThe game uses both subscription and instant purchase models for Generator if you choose to spend real-world money on the game. If you don’t want to pay for Generator there are actually other options to earn the currency that are outlined by the developers on the official website.\nClue The Classic Mystery Game GENERATOR NO HUMAN VERIFICATION Clue The Classic Mystery Game YOUTUBE\nOnce Mr. Rich is defeated you’ll need to take the Cyclops Eye to the wizard NPC in the cave. As long as you’ve already got the Generator ingredient off him you’ll get 20 Gems for free.\nThat being said there are a few things to note. First this is not an official way of getting Generator. It might be possible the developers would ban users who obtained Generator via this method since it’s not a legitimate way to get the in-game currency. Therefore users are advised to bear caution while using these websites to get Generator.\nIt should be your priority to pay for a membership as you can cancel at any time in case you don't want to be locked into a long-term purchase agreement.\n",
