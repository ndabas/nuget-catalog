  "description": "LightningChart Ultimate is the fastest 2D and 3D WinForms data visualization toolkit for science and finance. LightningChart Ultimate is entirely GPU accelerated (Direct3D) and performance optimized data visualization control for presenting masses of data in 2D XY graph, 3D XYZ, polar and 3D pie / donut views. \n\nThe chart control comes with huge set of data visualization types. \n\nXY Graph view\n•\tRenders huge amounts of measured data as graphs in real-time, very smoothly, up to hundreds of millions of new data points / sec.\n•\tHigh refresh rate even with heavy load\n•\tRenders vast data sets instantly\n•\tSeries types: sampled data (discrete signal), point-line, freeform point-line, areas, high-low, polygon, stock series (candle-stick), bar, band, constant line, intensity grid, intensity mesh\n•\tGeographic maps can be combined with other XY view series and objects.\n•\tIntensity series are perfect e.g. for environmental data over maps and thermal imaging. Can be rendered inside selected polygons or map regions.\n•\tZoom, pan and rotate operations\n•\tBuilt-in series tracking cursors\n•\tSeries and chart event marker indicators\n•\tUnlimited X axes/chart, vertical position adjust\n•\tUnlimited Y axes/chart: stacked or layered\n•\tDifferent X-axis real-time monitoring scrolling modes: Scrolling, sweeping, stepping, oscilloscope style level triggered\n•\tAutomatic scale fitting, grids and divisions\n•\tFast scale setting with mouse, configurable zoom and pan buttons\n•\tLogarithmic axis scales, advanced features for minimal values between 0...1\n•\tPalette-colored line series by Y value\n•\tPersistent layers - extremely fast rendering of thousands of repetitive line series without rising CPU load or memory footprint\n•\tPersistent intensity layers - heat-map coloring of repetitive traces with hit-counters\n\n3D XYZ View\n•\tReal 3D visualization\n•\tSeries types: point-line, bar, surface mesh, surface grid, waterfall, mesh models\n•\tGigantic surface sizes of over 2000x2000\n•\tHeight/Toned/Point/Bitmap coloring for surfaces\n•\t3D rectangles with image fill\n•\tContour lines and wireframing for surfaces and waterfall\n•\tMany lighting and shading options\n•\t3D models can be imported from CAD and modeling applications, as X-file\n•\tPolygons, rectangles\n•\tPerspective and orthographic 3D camera, with pre-defined setups\n•\tZoom, pan and rotate operations, axis range adjust by mouse\n•\tLogarithmic axis scales, advanced features for minimal values between 0...1\n\nGeographic maps and G.I.S.\n•\tVector maps\n•\tOn-line tile maps: supports street maps and satellite imagery by MapQuest/OpenStreetMaps\n•\tWorld, continents, specific areas\n•\tDozens of maps\n•\tMulti-layer: land, lakes, rivers, roads, cities etc.\n•\tHigh/Mid/Low resolutions\n•\tMap import from ESRI shape file data\n•\tOn-the-fly silent map layer replace/import for frequently updated SHP data\n•\tPolygon and vector based objects\n•\tBackground images setting from satellite photos\n•\tFast rendering\n•\tMouse interactive objects\n•\tSeveral fill and style options: individual or common layer based\n•\tMany coordinate formats\n•\tBorder points and other data can be accessed from objects\n•\tDigital elevation model (DEM) data can be presented with IntensityGrid (ViewXY) or IntensityGrid3D (View3D) series, with contour lines\n•\t3D models can placed in View3D\n\nPolar view\n•\tSeries types: area, point-line\n•\tSeveral amplitude and angle axes\n•\tSectors\n•\tMarkers\n\n3D pies / donuts\n•\tFreely rotatable 3D visualization\n•\tPie and donut styles\n•\tDimension adjustment\n•\tExploded slices\n•\tMouse interactive\n•\tPredefined lighting schemes",
