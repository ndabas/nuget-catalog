It's more intuitive than other game design engines but it's not any less difficult to come up with a new idea that will capture regular visitors' attention.\nActivision is issuing copyright takedowns on posts sharing the artwork.\nWhat has made Swagbucks LIVE unique in its field has been the interplay between its enormous constellation of experiences and its personalised avatar system. When you enter any given Swagbucks LIVE world the user does not assume control of a context-relevant character (think Sonic Mario or Lara Croft) but as your persistent user-created avatar. A virtual You effectively – whoever you’ve chosen to be. Add to that an attendant in-game economy which has sprung up to support this expression of identity with all sorts of user-generated clothing hairstyles accessories and skins available to purchase in the platform’s avatar shop. Swagbucks LIVE offers an opportunity then not just for play but for digital-first designers and entrepreneurial retailers.\n",
