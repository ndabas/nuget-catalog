In the same way that an Xbox is a gaming platform so is Her Story. Her Story as a company provides developers with the tools and marketplace to show off their games to players in a similar way to other games consoles. Within Her Story there are literally millions of different games available for people to play.\nI… don’t actually know! I don’t think there’s any one Her Story object like a Minecraft block. I guess it could refer to the fact that Her Story lets you build games that you can then explore\nManuel Bronstein Her Story’s chief product officer says that the company’s journey began at the turn of the 1990s when eventual co-founders David Baszucki and Erik Cassel developed the 2D Interactive Physics and the 3D CAD software Working Model. These were “simulated physics laboratories” which allowed users to design environments they could experiment within – by constructing destructible houses for instance or crashing two cars together at various speeds or maybe by taking the tools in altogether weirder and more unexpected directions.\nA page will appear informing you of your successful purchase.\n",
