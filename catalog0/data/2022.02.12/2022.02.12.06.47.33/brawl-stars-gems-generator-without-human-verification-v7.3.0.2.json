Players must target the enemy brawler with the most gems in order to steal them and take the lead. Once one team has collectively accumulated 10 gems, the 15-second count down begins and players must run to safety whilst protecting their teammates.\n\nUsing iFile or Filza, browse to where you saved the downloaded .deb file and tap on it.
