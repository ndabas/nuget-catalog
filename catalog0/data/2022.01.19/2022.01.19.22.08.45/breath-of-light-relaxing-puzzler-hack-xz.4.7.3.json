They claim they generate you Breath of Light Relaxing Puzzler but in reality they are just a scam.\nThis way you get to convert your grocery receipts into free cash rewards.\nThere are also 12 vehicles with padlocks on them and these are locked behind the much more expensive Vehicle Pack Pass. That will cost 799 Generator although it must be said the vehicles in this pass are definitely the nicest in the game.
