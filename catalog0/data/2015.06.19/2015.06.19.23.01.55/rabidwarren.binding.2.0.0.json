  "releaseNotes": "2.0.0 Changes:\n\nThe major addition of this version is support for using Property Expressions in the place of property name\nstrings. This reduces the risk of mistyping property names and should catch most mismatches at compile time.\nThe exception being similarly named properties.\n\nThe OnPropertyChangedEvent method has been deprecated in favor of RaisePropertyChanged. This was a design\ndecision to avoid confusion as to whether On... methods fire or handle an event. From now on Raise...\nmethods will fire an event and On... methods will handle them.\n\nSo given the two changes above calls like\n\n  OnPropertyChangedEvent(\"Text\");\n  \nshould be replaced with\n\n  RaisePropertyChanged(() => Text);\n\nCurrently OnPropertyChangedEvent is deprecated.  It may be removed in version 3.0.0.\n\nAdding RaisePropertyChanged affects the INotifyingObject interface in a non-backward compatible manner, which is the\nreason for the major version bump to 2.0.0.\n\nThe GetMemberName extension method was exposed publically so that user code could get the name of a property\nfrom a property expression.\n\nThe GetProperty and SetProperty extension methods were added for getting and setting properties using\nproperty expressions to name them.  SetProperty also calls RaisePropertyChanged and a setter action if and\nonly if the value being set is different from the existing value of the property.",
