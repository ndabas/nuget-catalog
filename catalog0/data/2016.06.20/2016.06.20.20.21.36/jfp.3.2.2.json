  "description": "A language as a library borrowing concepts from Lisp and Haskell. JFP contains functions which allow for gentle adoption of functional programming ideas for developers who are new to the functional paradigm. JFP embraces the dynamic nature of Javascript while supporting safe data typing.",

  "releaseNotes": "JFP is an opinionated, type-enforced functional programming library. JFP makes use of the Signet type\nlibrary, not only relying on the types for its own signatures, but also to provide rich type\ninteractions for the user of JFP.\n\nJFP is intended to be the foundation for a strong functional programming paradigm in Javascript\nwith roots in Scheme, but borrowing type and contract philosophies from other languages like\nScala. Many common utility functions are provided out of the box, but their contracts are \nbuilt around the idea that partial application and currying are fundamental to the construction\nof correct, reliable software in Javascript.\n\nJFP is not a drop-in replacement for Underscore, Lodash or Ramda. Instead it is built around the\nidea that Javascript is a dynamic language, but sometimes it needs a little help. Types are\nstrongly enforced only when weak enforcement would either limit the revealing of function\nintent or if contract violation would introduce broken or buggy behavior.\n\nLicensed under the Mozilla Public License (MPL).
