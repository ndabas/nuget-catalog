  "releaseNotes": "* License changed from LGPL to MIT\n\t\t\t* New Feature: Hide mouse cursor while typing (enabled by default)\n\t\t\t* New Feature: Highlight current line (disabled by default)\n\t\t\t* New Feature: Overstrike mode (disabled by default)\n\t\t\t* AvalonEdit now raises the WPF DataObject attached events on clipboard and drag'n'drop operations.\n\t\t\t* Encoding detection now distinguishes between UTF-8 with BOM and UTF-8 without BOM. This prevents AvalonEdit from adding the BOM to existing UTF-8 files.\n\t\t\t* Improved handling of grapheme clusters. A base character followed by a combining mark is now treated as a single character by the caret movement logic.\n\t\t\t* Added RichText, RichTextModel and RichTextColorizer.\n\t\t\t* Renamed the VB highlighting mode from \"VBNET\" to \"VB\"\n\t\t\t* Changed IHighlighter API in order to support SharpDevelop's semantic C# highlighter\n\t\t\t* The regex-based highlighting engine was moved into its own class (HighlightingEngine) to be separated from the state-tracking logic in DocumentHighlighter.\n\t\t\t* Add FileName property to TextDocument class.\n\t\t\t* DocumentChangeEventArgs.RemovedText/InsertedText are now of type ITextSource instead of string.\n\t\t\t* The error-tolerant XML parser included with AvalonEdit was removed. An improved version of this parser is part of the NRefactory 5 project.\n\t\t\t* Removed some obsolete APIs.",
