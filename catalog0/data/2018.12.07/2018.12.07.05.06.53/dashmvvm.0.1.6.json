  "releaseNotes": "Version 0.1.6 - Fixed bug that caused binding to multiple properties of the same view to different view model properties to cause DashMVVM to attempt to write to all of the bound view properties when just one view model property was updated. \nVersion 0.1.5 - Added support for binding of arbitrary properties of arbitrary objects\n        Version 0.1.4 - Changed textbox binding event from TextChanged to KeyUp to cater for cases when a textbox was cleared via backspace key.\n        Version 0.1.3 - Fixed bug causing crash when trying to list an object with a null property in a list. Also fixed bug causing list to display repeated values in columns.\n        Version 0.1.2 - Added initial support for checkboxes.\n        Version 0.1.1 - Misc bug fixes.\n        Version 0.1.0 - Fixed below bug but for real this time.\n        Version 0.0.9 - Fixed bug causing ListViews without columns not to populate.\n        Version 0.0.8 - Improved support for ListViews by adding capability to specify column headers and their widths.\n        Version 0.0.7 - Transfered binding functionality from DashView to a DashViewHandle component, this allows binding without necessarily inheriting the DashView\n        Version 0.0.6 - Fixed bug that was causing the Binder to attempt to assign values to comboboxes on background threads instead of the UI thread in multithreaded code.\n        Version 0.0.5 - Improved support for Comboboxes by implementing two-way binding.\n        Version 0.0.4 - Added support for Comboboxes \n        https://github.com/nyingi/DashMVVM/blob/master/README.md",
